Issuance Date: 13 December 2022 Corresponding to: 19 Jumada Al Owla 1444 HijriSaif Saeed Ghobash Secretary-General \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003  \u0003 General Policy for the Management, Regulation and Protection of Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi. 2022. 1. Introduction This Policy reviews the existing state of groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the challenges and implications of its depletion. One of the major challenges facing groundwater is the depletion of the reservoir as that the extraction rates exceed the natural recharge \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 It also defines its underlying principles and the relevant legal framework. Groundwater is one of the main natural resources, and the ratio of the total use of freshwater (which includes both surface water and fossil groundwater) out of the total renewable water resources available is one of the indicators by which water scarcity is measured, taking into account that the results are equalised through a weight that is determined to reflect the use of desalinated water and treated wastewater. In this context, although the water scarcity index in the Emirate is one of the lowest in the world, the Emirate records one of the h ighest rates of per capita water consumption. Most groundwater resources are surface aquifers, which are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity. Most of the groundwater reservoirs in the Emirate are non - renewable. Groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water resources consumed in the Emirate and is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. The Policy is drawn up in implementation of the provisions of Law No. (5) of 2016 concerning the Regulation of Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\u0003rates. This depletion caused a decrease in groundwater levels and a deterioration of its quality in many areas, where 79% of it has become highly saline,18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water. The deterioration of groundwater quality affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector, which plays an important role in achieving food security and stimulating related economic activities. It also has economic consequences manifested in resorting to other water sources such as desalinated water and recycled water that requires investments for transportation and distribution . In addition, the increase of groundwater salinity leads to the need to maintain and replace irrigation networks, which increases costs for farmers. From the environmental point of view, the deterioration of the quality of groundwater and its lower level s causes the agricultural sector to depend on small desalination plants, which in turn cause various environmental impacts, such as high greenhouse gas emissions. In response to the foregoing, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi adopts, through this Policy, the necessary measures to ensure the integrated and effective use of the various water resources, through sustainable management, as well as through the regulation, management and monitoring of groundwater. \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 2. Scope of Application This Policy is implemented in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and is supervised by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi, through consultation, coordination and cooperation with the concerned entities, whether within the governmental or the private sector, \u0003well as through analysing the economic, s ocial, environmental, technical, health and organisational impacts, based on systematic and organised procedures that contribute to achieving the objectives sought. \u0003 3. Main Principles Underlying the Policy This Policy is based on several main principles related to groundwater issues: The Issue Main Principles  Groundwater alternatives Encourage consumers to use alternative water sources for groundwater such as recycled water; taking into account economic, environmental, technical, organisational, social and health considerations. Conservation and efficient use of groundwater Ensure that all cur rent and future users maintain and rationalise groundwater use as efficiently as possible, using Water Demand Management policies. Allocation of agricultural lands Allocat e lands for agricultural purposes only in non -restricted areas with long - term sustainable water resources. Economic value of groundwater Educat e consumers about the economic value of groundwater and the importance of preserving it and rationalising its use . Research and development Direct research and development as a base for future foreseeing and promoting innovative technical solutions in terms of optimal use and preservation of groundwater. Emergencies Groundwater is used in emergencies as an alternative source of water in such cases. \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 4. Legal Framework Article (3) of Law No. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi stipulates that the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi shall have the competence to: ‘Draw up the General Policy related to the management, regulation and protection of groundwater, in coordination with the entity concerned with energy in the Emirate, and submit it to the Executive Council for approval.’ 5. Analysis The existing state of groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi The existing state of groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi can be summarised as follows: • Groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water consumed in the Emirate (Groundwater Atlas of Abu Dhabi Emirate, 2018). • Groundwater is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. \u0003• Groundwater extraction rates in the Emirate are about 24 times the rates of natural recharge. • The state of the groundwater is constantly deteriorating as the levels of deterioration in some areas have led to their classification as restricted areas. • The increasing demand for groundwater requires joint or coordinated initiatives with various stakeholders and actors involved. \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 Groundwater resources in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi Surface aquifers are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity, and most groundwater reservoirs in the Emirate are non -renewable reservoirs. Because of the excessive pumping of water from these reservoirs, groundwater levels decreased and groundwater quality deteriorated in many areas, as 79% of it became highly saline water, 18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water, according to the classification of water quality depending on salinity, which was developed by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi. Pressures the food sufficiency rate, greening the desert, and expanding parks and gardens also contribu ted to an increase of demand for irrigation water, despite the existing effort among the concerned entities on the importance and necessity of preserving groundwater and the shift in policies and legislation to focus on groundwater preservation. The low ra te of water renewal, the lack of efficient irrigation techniques and the selection of crop quality contribute to increasing pressures, and cause excessive consumption of groundwater in the Emirate, as the demand for groundwater has reached unsustainable le vels, leading to its depletion and to the deterioration of its quality. The results of the Groundwater Well Inventory project in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi indicate that the use of groundwater in the Emirate reached 2,100 million cubic meters in \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 Irrigation of crops and irrigation of forests increases the demand for groundwater.

(Groun dwater Atlas of Abu Dhabi Emirate, 2018).\u0003 Water Stress Index in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates and a number of other countries International reports show that the United Arab Emirates ranked tenth in the world in the list of countries with the highest levels of Water Stress, which is an indicator that measures the withdrawal of fresh water a s a percentage of the fresh water resources available . According to the World Resources Institute, the level of Water Stress in the State reached 4.26, while the average for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi was slightly higher, as it reached 4.44 in 2019.    In comparison with countries in the region, the rate of water withdrawal in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is 24 times the rate of natural recharge, while the rate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is 6 times higher, and 2.5 times in the Sultanate of Oman (National Water Strategy 2030, Saudi Arabia, 2018 and the Report on the State of Groundwater in the Sultanate of Oman 2019).            * World  Resources Institute, 2019 (Aquaduct project) - Water Stress Index  \u0003Water Stress Index and comparison with a number of countries in the region and the world (Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of freshwater resources available) * - 2019 - Water Stress Level \u00034.44 is the rate for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi \u0003State\u0003 United States \u0003 Denmark\u0003 Germany\u0003 Egypt\u0003 UAE\u0003 Saudi Arabia\u0003 Kuwait\u0003global ranking \u0003 \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003   Economic and social effects The increase in the demand for groundwater results in a deterioration of its quality which affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector. Preserving groundwater contributes to sustainable agricultural development, and thus to an increase in gross domestic product. Agriculture plays a crucial role in achieving food security and stimulating other related economic activities. During the past decades, the number of agricultural holdings has increased 38 times, from 634 holdings in 1971 to 24,018 ho ldings in 2019, while the area of agricultural lands has increased 33 times \u0003 \u0003  from around 22 thousand dunams to around 750 thousand dunams during the same period. Agriculture currently contributes to less than 1% of the Emirate's GDP. The government provides an integrated support system for the agricultural sector, such as vital security programmes that include the Palm Pest Control Programme, the Invasive Insects and Pest Control Programme, and technical programmes such as agricultural extension and training of farm workers to raise their efficiency and enhance their expertise. In this context, the Abu Dhabi Authority for Agriculture and Food Safety provided during the first quarter of the year 2020 more than AED 271.4 million to farmers benefiting fro m the Programme to Improve Farmers’ Incomes \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 implemented by the Authority, and more than 13 thousand farmers have benefited from it since the year 2000. Agricultural support policies have witnessed a change from focusing on production quantities to maintaining the quality of farms and encouraging sel f- sufficiency for their owners. Due to the deterioration of groundwater quality, alternatives of desalinated water and treated wastewater that require capital and operational investments for transportation and distribution are currently being resorted to. The salinity of groundwater also affects the irrigation networks and the need to rehabilitate and replace them over short periods of time. Groundwater depletion affects the abundance of groundwater reserves, which are considered strategic reserves for f uture generations. This will have negative effects on agricultural products, thus affecting the income and returns of farmers and farm owners. It also leads to the need to provide alternatives of fresh water as a strategic reserve. In addition, the extrac tion and use of groundwater takes place without placing any direct cost on the users, as the Study on the Economic Assessment of \u0003 \u0003  \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 its quality and to lower agricultural production. Because of the lack of alternatives, reliance is placed on small desalination plants in farms, which Expected results of applying the Policy on the economic and social level s 1. 2. The use of alternative water will lead to the continuation of agricultural activities in areas where the quantity and quality of groundwater is deteriorating. 3. A shift will be made to higher economic value crops with efficient water consumption, which will lead to an expected gradual improvement in the value of agricultural products. 4. The development of programmes and services for the agricultural sector will lead to a better alignment with the needs of farmers in the context of water use efficiency. \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, conducted by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi, indicates that the estimated economic value of each cubic meter of groundwater ranges between AED 7.7 and AED 9, and the economic value is the estimated total groundwater in Abu Dhabi ranges between AED 15.5 and AED 18 billion annually.  Environmental effects The decrease of usable groundwater reserves leads to its depletion and to deterioration of its quality.

Given the dependence of the forest sector on groundwater for irrigation, there are environmental impacts on biodiversity (plants and animals) as a result of the deterioration of the quality and quantity of groundwater used in this sector.  The methods of disposing of the return water resulting from the desalination of groundwater in farms and the use of pesticides and fertilisers also affect the quality of groundwater and soil. \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003Expected results of applying the Policy on the environmental level The Policy is expected to achieve positive environmental impacts as follows: 1. Decrease of groundwater extraction by 650 million cubic meters by 2030. 2. Improvement of the groundwater quality index (locally and federally). 3. Decrease of the rate of water extraction versus the rate of recharge from 24 to 16 times by 2030. 4. The use of recycled water will enhance the recharge of the aquifer in the areas that are used for irrigation (in terms of quality and quantity). \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 6.

(5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi.\\x03rates. this depletion caused a decrease in groundwater levels and a deterioration of its quality in many areas, where 79% of it has become highly saline,18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water. the deterioration of groundwater quality affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector, which plays an important role in achieving food security and stimulating related economic activities. it also has economic consequences manifested in resorting to other water sources such as desalinated water and recycled water that requires investments for transportation and distribution . in addition, the increase of groundwater salinity leads to the need to maintain and replace irrigation networks, which increases costs for farmers. from the environmental point of view, the deterioration of the quality of groundwater and its lower level s causes the agricultural sector to depend on small desalination plants, which in turn cause various environmental impacts, such as high greenhouse gas emissions. in response to the foregoing, the emirate of abu dhabi adopts, through this policy, the necessary measures to ensure the integrated and effective use of the various water resources, through sustainable management, as well as through the regulation, management and monitoring of groundwater. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 2. scope of application this policy is implemented in the emirate of abu dhabi, and is supervised by the environment agency - abu dhabi, through consultation, coordination and cooperation with the concerned entities, whether within the governmental or the private sector, \\x03well as through analysing the economic, s ocial, environmental, technical, health and organisational impacts, based on systematic and organised procedures that contribute to achieving the objectives sought. \\x03 3. main principles underlying the policy this policy is based on several main principles related to groundwater issues: the issue main principles  groundwater alternatives encourage consumers to use alternative water sources for groundwater such as recycled water; taking into account economic, environmental, technical, organisational, social and health considerations. conservation and efficient use of groundwater ensure that all cur rent and future users maintain and rationalise groundwater use as efficiently as possible, using water demand management policies. allocation of agricultural lands allocat e lands for agricultural purposes only in non -restricted areas with long - term sustainable water resources. economic value of groundwater educat e consumers about the economic value of groundwater and the importance of preserving it and rationalising its use . research and development direct research and development as a base for future foreseeing and promoting innovative technical solutions in terms of optimal use and preservation of groundwater. emergencies groundwater is used in emergencies as an alternative source of water in such cases. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 4. legal framework article (3) of law no.

      "Content: executive council resolution no. (182) of 2022 concerning the general policy for the management, regulation and protection of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi the executive council has decided the following: the general policy for the management, regulation and protection of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi shall be approved in accordance with the (attached form). issuance date: 13 december 2022 corresponding to: 19 jumada al owla 1444 hijrisaif saeed ghobash secretary-general \u0003 classification: confidential \u0003 ©sader\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003  \u0003 general policy for the management, regulation and protection of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi environment agency - abu dhabi. 2022. 1. introduction this policy reviews the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi and the challenges and implications of its depletion. one of the major challenges facing groundwater is the depletion of the reservoir as that the extraction rates exceed the natural recharge \u0003 classification: confidential \u0003 ©sader\u0003 \u0003 it also defines its underlying principles and the relevant legal framework. groundwater is one of the main natural resources, and the ratio of the total use of freshwater (which includes both surface water and fossil groundwater) out of the total renewable water resources available is one of the indicators by which water scarcity is measured, taking into account that the results are equalised through a weight that is determined to reflect the use of desalinated water and treated wastewater. in this context, although the water scarcity index in the emirate is one of the lowest in the world, the emirate records one of the h ighest rates of per capita water consumption. most groundwater resources are surface aquifers, which are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity. most of the groundwater reservoirs in the emirate are non - renewable. groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water resources consumed in the emirate and is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. the policy is drawn up in implementation of the provisions of law no. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi.\u0003rates. this depletion caused a decrease in groundwater levels and a deterioration of its quality in many areas, where 79% of it has become highly saline,18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water. the deterioration of groundwater quality affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector, which plays an important role in achieving food security and stimulating related economic activities. it also has economic consequences manifested in resorting to other water sources such as desalinated water and recycled water that requires investments for transportation and distribution . in addition, the increase of groundwater salinity leads to the need to maintain and replace irrigation networks, which increases costs for farmers. from the environmental point of view, the deterioration of the quality of groundwater and its lower level s causes the agricultural sector to depend on small desalination plants, which in turn cause various environmental impacts, such as high greenhouse gas emissions. in response to the foregoing, the emirate of abu dhabi adopts, through this policy, the necessary measures to ensure the integrated and effective use of the various water resources, through sustainable management, as well as through the regulation, management and monitoring of groundwater. \u0003 classification: confidential \u0003 ©sader\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 2. scope of application this policy is implemented in the emirate of abu dhabi, and is supervised by the environment agency - abu dhabi, through consultation, coordination and cooperation with the concerned entities, whether within the governmental or the private sector, \u0003well as through analysing the economic, s ocial, environmental, technical, health and organisational impacts, based on systematic and organised procedures that contribute to achieving the objectives sought. \u0003 3. main principles underlying the policy this policy is based on several main principles related to groundwater issues: the issue main principles  groundwater alternatives encourage consumers to use alternative water sources for groundwater such as recycled water; taking into account economic, environmental, technical, organisational, social and health considerations. conservation and efficient use of groundwater ensure that all cur rent and future users maintain and rationalise groundwater use as efficiently as possible, using water demand management policies. allocation of agricultural lands allocat e lands for agricultural purposes only in non -restricted areas with long - term sustainable water resources. economic value of groundwater educat e consumers about the economic value of groundwater and the importance of preserving it and rationalising its use . research and development direct research and development as a base for future foreseeing and promoting innovative technical solutions in terms of optimal use and preservation of groundwater. emergencies groundwater is used in emergencies as an alternative source of water in such cases. \u0003 classification: confidential \u0003 ©sader\u0003 \u0003 4. legal framework article (3) of law no. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi stipulates that the environment agency - abu dhabi shall have the competence to: ‘draw up the general policy related to the management, regulation and protection of groundwater, in coordination with the entity concerned with energy in the emirate, and submit it to the executive council for approval.’ 5. analysis the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi can be summarised as follows: • groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water consumed in the emirate (groundwater atlas of abu dhabi emirate, 2018). • groundwater is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. \u0003• groundwater extraction rates in the emirate are about 24 times the rates of natural recharge. • the state of the groundwater is constantly deteriorating as the levels of deterioration in some areas have led to their classification as restricted areas. • the increasing demand for groundwater requires joint or coordinated initiatives with various stakeholders and actors involved. \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 classification: confidential \u0003 ©sader\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi surface aquifers are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity, and most groundwater reservoirs in the emirate are non -renewable reservoirs. because of the excessive pumping of water from these reservoirs, groundwater levels decreased and groundwater quality deteriorated in many areas, as 79% of it became highly saline water, 18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water, according to the classification of water quality depending on salinity, which was developed by the environment agency - abu dhabi. pressures the food sufficiency rate, greening the desert, and expanding parks and gardens also contribu ted to an increase of demand for irrigation water, despite the existing effort among the concerned entities on the importance and necessity of preserving groundwater and the shift in policies and legislation to focus on groundwater preservation. the low ra te of water renewal, the lack of efficient irrigation techniques and the selection of crop quality contribute to increasing pressures, and cause excessive consumption of groundwater in the emirate, as the demand for groundwater has reached unsustainable le vels, leading to its depletion and to the deterioration of its quality. the results of the groundwater well inventory project in the emirate of abu dhabi indicate that the use of groundwater in the emirate reached 2,100 million cubic meters in \u0003 classification: confidential \u0003 ©sader\u0003 \u0003 irrigation of crops and irrigation of forests increases the demand for groundwater. the number of agricultural holdings in a bu dhabi increased by 38 times during the period from 1971 to 2019. the policies of expanding the agricultural sector, striving to achieve food security, raising \u00032017.

The Public Policy Framework setoutinthisdocument willbring consistency totheway public policy ismade within theEmirate ofAbu Dhabi and ensure that evidence and analysis areattheheart ofallinterventions andrequests .Itprovides policy -makers within theAbu Dhabi Government with astep-by-step guide todeveloping effective public policy, andemphasizes theimportance ofcontinuous improvement byproviding tools tomonitor, evaluate, andreport onpolicy implementation. The framework has been designed using global best practice and experience, and will ensure that theEmirate ofAbu Dhabi isattheforefront ofhigh-quality evidence -based policymaking foryears tocome . Iurge allthose across thegovernment toread and usethis manual .Itrepresents an important step inourongoing journey toenhance thequality andservices offered by theGovernment ofAbu Dhabi . 4  ABOUT THIS MANUALContent Purpose Figure 1: Legend Guidance on key topics Suggested tools and techniques to aid each step Checklists to review completion of key activities for each step Guidance for approvals Guidance on how stakeholders can be engaged Examples to bring this manual to life Thepurpose ofthismanual istoprovide aunified framework toguide public policy -makers, within government entities andpublic companies, indrafting consistent andcomprehensive public policies, andtofoster continuous improvement through effective reporting cycles .It isinformed byglobal best practices andaligns withtheUAE ’sexisting policy tools . This manual offers step-by-step guidelines onhow todevelop, appraise, implement, and evaluate public policy interventions .Itpresents suggested tools andtechniques inaddition tohighlighting theimportant rolethatstakeholders have inthecompleteness andaccuracy ofthepolicy .Additionally, itprovides guidance fordeveloping proposals through aBusiness Case tobetter inform theExecutive Council ’sdecision -making process . The legend inFigure 1supports innavigating between thesupplementary figures and information provided within thismanual : 5 Section 1: Overview 6 Chapter 1: What is public policy? 7  The concept of ‘policy ’iscomplex, hasseveral dimensions and canlend itself todifferent interpretations .In general, apolicy isastatement thatsets outagovernment ’sintention, guiding principles, andthepractical action thatisundertaken torealise asetofdesired objectives. However, thisbroad definition needs toberefined to reflect how public policy ispracticed intheEmirate ofAbu Dhabi .This chapter explores thedifferent types of policies and requests thatareproduced across theGovernment and provides guidance and advice onwhich should beconsidered within thescope ofthismanual andthewider Public Policy Framework .Chapter 1: What is public policy? 8Policies can broadly bebroken down into three main types :‘public policies ’,‘operational policies ’and ‘organisational policies ’.The core distinction between thethree types isdefined bytheir domain (public or private) andtheimpact they have onstakeholders : •Public policies aretheGovernment ’schosen course ofaction, orinaction, onanissue ofpublic concern .They generate economic, social andenvironmental impacts andinvolve multiple stakeholders, including government departments, businesses, households and civil society .Public Policies canbeexpressed indifferent forms : visions, overarching public policies, strategies andspecific public policy interventions (Figure 2). •Operational policies areacourse ormethod ofaction selected byanentity todeal with operational matters when engaging with itsstakeholders .Examples include facility licensing policies orissuing birth certification policies ;and, •Organisational policies areacourse ormethod ofaction selected byanentity toguide anddetermine how internal human resource and financial management issues willbedealt with.They dictate rules within the entity ’sadministrative procedures .Anexample ofthisisbusiness continuity policies .Types of Policies The Government Policy Pyramid Government Policy beexpressed indifferent forms : •Visions reflect thedesired future state andincludes specific priorities andideas ; •Overarching Public Policies arederived from theGovernment ’svision and outline thehigh-level public policy positions onspecific issues ; •Strategies arelong-term plans forrealising theGovernment ’svision andoverarching public policy positions; and, •Public Policy Interventions aretargeted actions taken bytheGovernment toachieve specific policy objectives .Thescope ofthismanual isthedevelopment ofthislayer ofgovernment policy . When scoping and designing public policy interventions, and producing therequired Business Case, itis important forrequesting entities andpolicymakers tobeaware oftheinteractions between public policy and wider Government and departmental strategy .Assetoutearlier inthechapter, theBusiness Case that requesting entities arerequired toproduce isdesigned specifically forpublic policy interventions, butin producing these cases entities willneed toconsider anddiscuss thelinkbetween theintervention andwider Government strategy . Figure 2: Public Policy Pyramid The example below explains therelationship between thedifferent expressions ofpublic policy using general healthcare asanexample : Tofulfil its Vision DOH designed several overarching public policies that address themain components ofthe Abu Dhabi healthcare system such asthe ‘DOH Policy on Digital Health ’.Overarching Public PoliciesVision Thevision oftheAbu Dhabi Department forHealth (DOH) is‘aHealthy andSafe AbuDhabi ’. Strategies DOH implemented anumber ofregulatory and non regulatory public policy interventions, toexecute itshigh level policy andstrategy .Forexample theestablishment of Malaffi ,aninnovative, unified health information exchange (HIE) platform that facilitates amore patient -centric approach tohealthcare provision.Public Policy InterventionsTorealize the above Overarching Public Policy DOH designed an ‘e-Health Strategy ’.This would involve setting aplan onhow toprioritize theambitions oftheDOH Policy onDigital Health Asthe Public Policy Pyramid indicates, public policy interventions can bederived from either the Government ’soverall vision, itsoverarching public policies, oritslonger -term strategies .Itisimportant thatthe proposed interventions arealigned with theoverall strategic direction oftheentity inquestion, aswellasthe priorities ofboth theEmirate ofAbuDhabi andtheUAE.Inanideal scenario, each level ofGovernment action would flow from thevision and/or overarching public policies (Figure 2),andthisshould bediscussed intheBusiness Case .Inpractice, thiswillnotalways bethe case .Itshould benoted thatalternative definitions ofpublic policy exist, butthatthisisthedefinition applied forthepurposes ofthePublic Policy Framework . Requesting entities submit many different types ofrequests toADEO andtheExecutive Council, including different types ofpublic policy proposals, different non-public policy requests andarange ofother different documents forconsultation andapproval (Figure 3).The different types of requests that qualify as public policy interventions Figure 3: Types of submissions New, amendment or exemption to: Scope In scope Out of scope Out of scope Out of scope Out of scopeOut of scopeIn scopeIn scope Fiscal instruments Information provision Additional budget Memorandums of understanding / Agreements Complaints EventsCapital projects (admin)RegulationsDescription Laws, Emiri decrees, decisions oftheChairman ofthe Executive Council, decisions ofthe Executive Council, circulars, and executive and administrative orders .

One ofADEO ’skey roles istocontinually improve theeffectiveness and efficiency oftheAbu Dhabi Government, andtosupport theExecutive Council inmaking robust, well-evidenced decisions when itcomes tointroducing, changing orremoving public policy interventions .Byproducing aBusiness Case tosupport their proposed policy changes, requesting entities willprovide theExecutive Council with therequired information, evidence and analysis toallow them toappraise different options effectively .Further detail regarding theBusiness Case, andhow todevelop it,isprovided inChapter 2ofthismanual . Chapter 2: The Abu Dhabi Public Policy Framework Chapter 2: The Abu Dhabi Public Policy Framework This manual, and theaccompanying documents, contains theAbu Dhabi Public Policy Framework .The objectives oftheFramework aretobring consistency topublic policy development intheEmirate ofAbuDhabi, toensure thatpublic policy ismade inaholistic, coherent andconsultative way, tostreamline theinteractions between requesting entities andADEO, andtolinkpolicy design toimplementation andreview . 2.1 The Public Policy Cycle Public policy making istheexercise ofidentifying andselecting initiatives thatsupport agovernment entity in achieving specific objectives orgoals .Itisaniterative process that isconceptualised inthismanual infour stages :Agenda Setting ,Design andAppraise ,Implement, andMonitor andEvaluate (Figure 4). This document contains detailed guidance andsupport topolicy -makers onhow tonavigate each stage ofthis cycle, aswell asproviding advice onhow tomanage theapproval processes during theAgenda Setting and Design andAppraise stages . Section 2ofthismanual isdedicated toeach ofthese keystages ofthePublic Policy Cycle andprovides support topolicy -makers toguide them through theprocess .Inaddition tothecore sections, several further pieces of guidance andtools have been developed tohelp requesting entities complete each ofthePublic Policy Cycle stages . 13Figure 4: The Public Policy Cycle The Public Policy CycleWhat is the problem and what do we want to achieve? What is the best way of achieving this?

Inaddition, itadvises policy makers onthelevel ofdetail required atthedifferent design steps inorder tobuild a comprehensive policy thatcanbeimplemented successfully .Both thedetail oftheintervention design andthe level ofsupporting evidence should increase asapublic policy intervention progresses through thecycle .Thesupporting tools andtemplates, along withthismanual, make uptheAbuDhabi Public Policy Toolbox .This should beused byallrequesting entities tohelp navigate thedifferent stages ofthePublic Policy Cycle . Although thePublic Policy Toolbox isextensive, itisnotexhaustive andrequesting entities should make useof their own analytical tools andinternal processes where necessary andappropriate .Thethree tools are:2.2 The Public Policy Toolbox 14The Appraisal Tool :Atoolforappraising policy intervention options against each other .The Public Policy Manual :Practical guidelines onhow toidentify, design, appraise, implement, monitor andevaluate public policy interventions ; The Business Case Template :Atemplate forsubmitting policy intervention proposals andsupporting evidence ; Figure 5: The Public Policy Toolbox Stage of the Public Policy Cycle Toolbox 1 Agenda setting 3 Implement 4 Monitor and evaluate2 Design and appraisePublic Policy Manual Business Case Template Appraisal Tool Appraisal ToolBusiness Case Template Public Policy Manual Tosupport requesting entities inbuilding their case, atemplate hasbeen designed where they cansetout therequired information, evidence, data and analysis they need before they submit their proposal for approval . The Business Case Template ensures thatsubmitted proposals areholistic, coherent, andsupported bya proportionate level ofevidence inorder toinform keydecision -making atthedifferent approval stages .There arethree core areas thatneed tobecovered ineach proposal, andthese aresetoutinmore detail inFigure 6. Asshown inFigure 6,inorder toallow theExecutive Council tomake well-informed decisions, requesting entities need toprovide clear evidence oftheneed forgovernment intervention, detailed information about theproposed response, andarobust appraisal oftheexpected impacts across theEmirate ofAbuDhabi . When completing atemplate, requesting entities should follow thechronological steps thathave been aligned tothedifferent stages ofthePublic Policy Cycle .Further detailed support onhow tocomplete theBusiness Case Template, including further information around how italigns with theAppraisal Tool, isincluded within thetemplate . 15Figure 6: The Business Case What is the problem to be addressed? Rationale and objectives What is the need and desired end state? Policy design What is the action proposed for achieving the desired end state?Policy appraisal Why is this action proposed? Why should Government intervene? What objectives is it aiming to achieve?What is the proposed policy instrument ? What is the proposed policy scope ? What is the proposed implementation plan? What is the expected economic, social and environmental impact ? Is the policy technically, legally and financially feasible? Are there other strategic considerations ? TheAppraisal Tool hasbeen developed tosupport requesting entities inassessing andcomparing arange of potential policy interventions .The tool allows users toappraise several different options against apre- determined setofimpact criteria, tohelp determine which options should beselected forfurther analysis and development .TheAppraisal Tool includes several different criteria, which cover strategic, feasibility, andimpact considerations .This isshown inmore detail inFigure 7.

Further information onwhat isrequired ateach stage ofapproval, andthelevel ofevidence andanalysis that should beincluded foreach, isincluded inChapter 4ofthisdocument .Additional support andguidance isalso included atthebeginning oftheBusiness Case Template . The Public Policy Framework isdepicted, infull,inFigure 8.This infographic brings together allthedifferent components ofthePublic Policy Cycle andsupporting Public Policy Toolbox, andtheindividual steps required ofrequesting entities within each stage .Italso shows how, andwhen, requesting entities should engage with ADEO forapproval .Atthisstage, ADEO willreview theimplementation andmonitoring andevaluation plans thathave been designed byrequesting entities .Iffurther analysis was requested atthe Pre-Approval Stage, then this willalso bereviewed .Once reviewed, theExecutive Council willeither approve orreject theintervention .Note thattheintervention may be rejected because thesubmission isincomplete orlacks sufficient evidence. Inthis instance, theproposal willbereturned totherequesting entity forrework .The Appraisal Tool allows weights tobeassigned toeach assessment criteria either onanequal basis or through custom weighting, which allows foruser-defined weights based ontherelevance ofdifferent criteria to thedecision -making . 17Final ApprovalPre- ApprovalAtthisstage, ADEO willreview therationale forgovernment intervention, thelistof potential options thathave been identified, andtheanalysis thathasbeen produced to assess theimpacts that each option willhave .The analysis behind each option is expected tobebroadly qualitative and depict therange ofimpacts that thedifferent options may have .Detailed, quantitative analysis isnotrequired atthePre-Approval stage .

Indeveloping public policy interventions, governments respond toboth opportunities and problems .The Agenda Setting stage ofthePublic Policy Cycle isbased onaproblem -oriented approach topolicy analysis . This approach ischaracterised byundertaking adetailed analysis oftheunderlying problem before potential solutions areidentified .This isnottosuggest thatthegovernment cannot respond toopportunities, butrather thattheapproach taken inthismanual prioritises adetailed understanding ofthechallenge tobeaddressed, whether thegovernment isproactively orreactively addressing it. 23 ADEO Interaction (* = indicates mandatory step) Figure 9: Agenda setting stage overview 1 Agenda setting 3 Implement 4 Monitor and evaluate2 Design and appraiseStage of the Public Policy Cycle What is the problem and what do we want to achieve? Establish the rationale for government intervention 1.2 Set out the overall objectives of the intervention 1.3Diagnose the problem that needs to be addressed 1.1 Sounding Evidencing thecase forgovernment intervention isakeypartoftheAgenda Setting stage ofthePublic Policy Cycle .Aclear rationale forstate intervention should bebased onacomprehensive understanding ofthe challenge .This canbeachieved byanswering thefollowing core questions : 1.What isthenature ofthechallenge thatneeds tobeaddressed? 2.What isthesizeofthechallenge thatneeds tobeaddressed? 3.What aretheunderlying drivers behind thischallenge? 4.Why isgovernment intervention required?3.1 Identify and diagnose the problem that needs to be addressed These aresome fundamental techniques thatcanprovide crucial insights through primary data, existing bodies ofresearch, andexperiences inother countries . Establishing aclear definition ofthechallenge intheearly stages ofthePublic Policy Cycle isnecessary tohelp identify appropriate solutions .This process islikely tobeiterative and require different levels ofstakeholder engagement .Environmental Scanning, which involves identifying and tracking trends intheorganisation ’s internal andexternal environment, covers abroad range ofuseful techniques foridentifying challenges, whether they aredriven byproblems, challenges oropportunities. Horizon scanning (Figure 10)isauseful technique foridentifying and monitoring potentially important developments through thesystematic examination ofpotential threats and opportunities tothepolicy area in question .The approach isdriven bytheanalysis ofchanges, constants and uncertainties over defined time periods .Itrequires consideration ofboth existing andemerging phenomena, butalso how different issues may interact toinfluence future outcomes .What is the nature of the challenge that needs to be addressed? 2401Literature reviews :Reviewing academic papers, white papers orother theoretically -backed views that study andanalyse thechallenge inquestion ; Benchmarking :Examining themanifestation oftheproblem inother countries, theevolution ofthe challenge andreviewing thelessons learned from elsewhere; and, Primary data collection :Gathering primary data from first-hand sources, such assurveys, interviews, focus groups orexperiments togenerate situation -specific insights .Some core tools andtechniques thatcanbeapplied intheearly stages ofthePublic Policy Cycle todevelop a deep understanding ofthepolicy challenge are: Figure 10: Horizon scanning This three horizon model indicates how strategic andpolicy issues evolve over time: •Horizon 1captures immediate strategic andpolicy priorities which arereadily apparent andmay bewellunderstood .Ifnotalready, these issues should beonthepolicy agenda. •Horizon 2shows thatissues may evolve, ornew issues may arise, inthemedium term.These issues, although less well understood, may present opportunities totackling emerging issues through public policy interventions . •Horizon 3includes long-term strategic andpolicy issues which aredifficult todetermine from thepresent .Decision makers donotnecessarily need torespond toH3issues right now, although itisimportant toidentify andtrack thedrivers thatwillshape these issues.High Medium Low Long term Medium term Short term NowH3 H2 H1 Time horizonPriority 25Aproblem -oriented approach topublic policy analysis isreliant onasufficiently rigorous definition ofthepolicy challenge under consideration .Asmentioned atthebeginning ofthischapter, this can beachieved by deploying literature reviews, benchmarking studies orprimary data collection inorder toanswer aseries of predefined research questions . Itisimportant toaskwide-ranging andprobing questions intheearly stages oftheprocess .While specific questions willvary bypolicy area, theexample research questions could be: •Who isaffected? •How arethey affected? •What contributes totheproblem? •When andwhere istheproblem most likely tooccur? Inaddressing these questions, itisimportant tobeasspecific aspossible about thedifferent stakeholders who areimpacted bythedifferent aspects ofthepolicy challenge .The following table highlights thekeyinternal andexternal stakeholders toconsider when identifying theimpacted parties during intervention analysis. Table 2: Stakeholders Thestakeholders listed inTable 2aredeliberately defined atahigh-level, andinpractice willneed tobefurther broken down through segmentation and/or demographic analysis .Aparticular policy issue islikely toimpact specific groups more than others, andidentifying thespecific agents impacted byapublic policy isakeypartof theearly analysis. Atthisstage itisparticularly important toperform stakeholder mapping . Additional research into thenature ofthechallenge should also consider thespecific context, history and potential evolution oftheidentified problem(s) .Research questions tosupport thisadditional assessment could include: •What isthehistory ofthechallenge? •Who putthischallenge ontheagenda? •What arethespecific interests atstake (including demographic, geographic andsectoral)? •Who isinvolved inthedecision -making? Through detailed research andanalysis ofthequestions thataresetoutthroughout thischapter, requesting entities willbeable toprovide proportionate, well-reasoned evidence ofthenature andtype ofproblem(s) or challenge(s) . Businesses Economic stakeholders engaged in commercial, industrial, or professional activities, who transform factors of production into goods and services. Households Economic stakeholders who supply factors of production (labour and capital) and are consumers of final goods and services. Civil societyIndividuals or groups who share a common interest and are not connected to the government. Civil society organisations can mediate the relationships between public authorities and citizens. Government Entities engaged in public sector activities which pass laws, collect revenues and directly consume economic goods and services.Description Stakeholder Thebreadth ofissues covered bypolicy -makers often means thatachallenge may beidentified before thefull- scale orsizeisunderstood .Theprimary purpose ofthisstep istoestablish aquantitative understanding ofthe challenge .This willrequire aninitial estimation ofthesize and anunderstanding ofthedemographic, geographic orsectoral variation, aswell asabalance between targeted analysis ofspecific questions with exploratory analysis toreveal anyunknown characteristics ofthechallenge .What is the size of the challenge that needs to be addressed? This willrequire arange ofdata sources, including national statistics, departmental data, proprietary data sources andprimary data.Thecollection ofprimary data canbeparticularly important atthisstage because itis likely tobethemost specific information about thearea inquestion, however itcanbemore time consuming to collect andanalyse . Policy challenges willoften draw onarange ofaggregate estimates, including both monetary and non- monetary aggregates .Monetary statistics include market oreconomic valuations, where asnon-monetary statistics include measures offrequency, prevalence andcount, andpercentages . Tounderstand thepolicy challenge itmay benecessary todisaggregate overall estimates bydifferent characteristics .This caninclude demographic, geographic andsectoral analysis . Aggregate statistics may hide important characteristics ofthechallenge .Consequently, itisimportant tolook beyond aggregates tounderstand measures ofvariation .This includes central tendency (mean, median, and mode), dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), andposition (percentile, quartile andrank) . Different types ofdata analysis canbeused depending onthesalience ofthepolicy area, availability ofdata, and urgency oftherequest .Methods range from descriptive statistics and trend analysis, tomore complex economic orstatistical assessments .Forexample, supply and demand analysis (Figure 11)isparticularly useful forchallenges with implications formarket outcomes, participants orstructures, asitsupports the understanding ofthedynamics anddeterminants ofsupply anddemand .This technique canalso beadjusted toexamine both capacity andneeds, which provides anunconstrainted economic assessment ofthesupply or demand inagiven market . 2702 What data are available? What aggregate statistics are required to understand the size of the challenge? What disaggregated statistics are required to understand the size of the challenge? What measures of variation are required to understand the characteristics of the challenge? Figure 11: Supply (capacity) and demand (needs) analysis Define the market Divide total supply into its main components and understand production Forecast the drivers of supply and how this will change over time Conduct sensitivity analysis to understand assumptions and to gauge the risksIdentify who thesuppliers ofaproduct orservice are, considering potential substitutes fora product orservice, andthemarket structure . Divide industry supply into segments and perform analysis ofproduction variables, such as production costs, rawmaterial costs, technology andlabour costs . Statistical techniques such asregressions canbeused toidentify andmap these parameters .

Alogic tree isatool used tobreak down aproblem statement orquestion into itsmore simple subcomponents, allowing foreasier identification ofpotential rootcauses .Theapproach helps togroup thecauses anddrills down further intothedetails ofeach grouping until each issue issufficiently explicit . This means theissues must bemutually exclusive andcollectively exhaustive (MECE) . •'Mutually exclusive ’indicates thatthere isnooverlap between thesubcomponents •'Collectively exhaustive ’means thatthelogic treecovers allpotential rootcauses This exercise willprove helpful when identifying solutions toaddress theproblem statement, as responses may tackle theactual problem statement ortheindividual issues defining thecauses. Asimple example ofalogic treeisoutlined below :What are the underlying drivers behind this challenge? Acomprehensive problem analysis does notonly reveal thenature, sizeandlikely evolution ofaproblem, but isalso anindication ofthelikely causal -effect relationships that may beunderlying it.There anumber of methodologies andtechniques thatcanbedeployed atthisstage, ranging from qualitative problem solving tools, such asaroot cause analysis, oradvanced econometric orstatistical techniques .Logic tree analysis (Figure 12)isoneofseveral methodologies thatcanbeapplied tounderstand thedrivers behind aproblem . Figure 12: Logic tree analysis Issue 1 Sub-issue 1.1 Sub-issue 1.2Issue 2 Sub-issue 2.1 Sub-issue 2.2Problem statement 2903 Once thedrivers behind achallenge have been identified, itmay behelpful tomap them against anumber of different factors asthiscanhelp prioritise which issues should betackled asapriority . Driver mapping isused tomap thedrivers ofapolicy challenge based ontheir importance tothepolicy area andthecertainty ofoutcome . Consider thedrivers ofthechallenges identified through others means, such aslogic treeorthe analysis ofsupply ordemand, butalso consider wider factors through using thePolitical, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal andEnvironmental (PESTLE) framework . Map thedrivers based onimportance and certainty oftheoutcome, asshown intheexample below :EEconomic SSocietalPPolitical TTechnological LLegislative EEnvironmental More important for the policy area Less important for the policy areaThe outcome is certainThe outcome is uncertain Sofar,thischapter hasfocused onbuilding adetailed understanding oftheproblem(s) orissue(s) thatareat hand .The next partnow focusses onwhether government intervention isthebest option foraddressing them, andbrings these different assessments together .Figure 13: Driver mapping 3001 02 Why is government intervention required? Identifying aproblem, highlighting thesizeandscale oftheissue, andidentifying therootcauses ofthe challenge arenotsufficient ontheir own towarrant agovernment response .Before government intervention canbejustified, itisimportant toshowcase why government action isthebest way of dealing with theidentified problem and what would happen ifnoaction istaken .There isnosingle approach tojustifying government intervention, anditisimportant toconsider arange ofperspectives, including what would happen ifnointervention were totake place . 31013.2 Establish the rationale for government intervention Legalistic analysis oftheneed forgovernment intervention isoneapproach, andincludes addressing questions such as: •Isthere alegal basis forgovernment intervention? •Isgovernment intervention proportional tothesizeoftheproblem? •Isthepolicy area under theexclusive competence ofthegovernment ordepartment? Itisalso possible tojustify government intervention onthebasis ofeconomic grounds, including to address regulatory failure, market failure, ortopromote social orpublic goals .Forexample, theuseof logic trees may indicate thattheroot cause oftheissue isdriven byinappropriate regulatory design, leading toeconomic distortions andinefficient economic outcomes .Three examples ofpossible triggers forgovernment intervention areprovided inFigure 14. Market failure Market failure usually arises when thecurrent market system failstoefficiently allocate goods orservices .Forexample :Regulatory failure This can occur when regulations are not well - designed to address an issue and they result in unintended consequences. This can lead to costs for businesses and/or society. Social goals Government intervention may be required in order to address distributional or equality objectives, or advance specific priorities for the public good. Figure 14: Triggers for government intervention 320301 02Public goods :these are non-excludable (can be consumed byallwithout restriction) and non-rivalrous (can beconsumed byanynumber ofindividuals with no impact onbenefits) .They aretypically notprovided by markets (for example defense services) without government intervention . Imperfect information :Information isneeded for markets tooperate efficiently .Regulation may be needed toenforce information disclosure, forexample : providing terms andconditions when rendering services orproviding price transparency onreceipts . Externalities :these arethesocial costs and benefits thatarise from economic activities which areincurred by athird party who has nocontrol over thedecision to create that cost orbenefit .Forexample, thecost of pollution isfeltbythepublic rather than theindustry responsible forcreating it. Market power :this occurs when there isinsufficient competition inthemarket, due toeither thenumber of firms ormarket share offirms, resulting ininefficient prices, inadequate competition and consumer choice, bundling goods orservices, and dead weight loss.For example, amarket which isdominated byonefirmmay result inunjustifiably high consumer prices. The various techniques highlighted throughout thischapter aredesigned tohelp requesting entities identify problems across allpolicy areas, assess them effectively, and toidentify whether government intervention is required .The final partofthischapter addresses how toseteffective objectives andperformance indicators in order totackle theproblems thathave been identified above . Term Definition Example OutputsThe products, services or capital goods that result from an intervention.Establish a 24-hour service for customer support by 2021 OutcomesThe expected effects of interventions outputs.50% reduction in the number of complaints received by 2025 Itisimportant toengage with stakeholders throughout thisprocess toensure thatthevision andobjectives are aligned between therequesting entity, thewider Abu Dhabi Government and theUAE government .When identifying theobjectives, stakeholders should beconsulted andbenchmarking should beconducted . When setting objectives, itisrecommended to: 1.Consider alignment withstrategy ; 2.Engage stakeholders onobjectives; and 3.Ensure objectives follow theSMART Framework .3.3 Define the desired objective(s) When defining theobjectives ofapublic policy intervention, itisimportant toreflect how they willcontribute to achieving thegovernment ’soverarching priorities .Such objectives may beexpressed asoutputs oroutcomes andshould bealigned tothegovernment ’soverall strategic direction andarequesting entities ’mandate .Table 3 clarifies thedifference between outputs andoutcomes anduses asanexample thegovernment attempting to achieve itsstrategic priority ofenhancing customer satisfaction . Table 3: Outputs and outcomes The ability ofapolicy option tomeet thedesired objectives isacentral criteria intheoverall policy appraisal process .Itistherefore important thattheobjectives defined intheAgenda Setting stage areclosely aligned with theUAE’s,theEmirate ofAbu Dhabi ’sand therequesting entities ’strategy .The could beachieved by considering thefollowing questions foreach level ofgovernment : •What isthemission andpurpose? •What isthevision andstrategy? •What arethetarget outcomes?Consider alignment with strategy 3301 Itisalso important toconsider how theobjectives might impact thestrategy ofother government departments, particularly where thepolicy area islikely torequire collaboration withthedepartments inquestion . The absence ofclearly defined objectives may lead toimproper policy selection, ineffective appraisals, and subsequently ineffective policies .TheSMART Framework (Figure 16)provides guidance oncharacteristics that contribute towell-defined objectives .Engage stakeholders on objectives Figure 15: Engaging stakeholders on objectives The following questions may beuseful tohelp develop anunderstanding ofthespecific policy area, the emerging themes thatneed tobeaddressed andthepotential sources ofconflict : What is the critical issue for the area being considered? What is a favourable outcome? What is an unfavourable outcome? What are the key operational, structural and cultural changes that need to be made to deliver the favourable outcome? What are the key lessons from past experience? Which decisions must be prioritised?

Inthis instance, theproposal willbereturned totherequesting entity forrework .Final ApprovalPre- ApprovalAtthisstage, ADEO willreview therationale forgovernment intervention, thelistof potential options thathave been identified, andtheanalysis thathasbeen produced to assess theimpacts that each option willhave .The analysis behind each option is expected tobebroadly qualitative and depict therange ofimpacts that thedifferent options may have .Detailed, quantitative analysis isnotrequired atthePre-Approval stage . The first step intheDesign and Appraise stage istoidentify anumber ofpolicy options that could be implemented inorder toachieve thedesired objectives .These options should address theinitially identified problem(s), ortheroot cause(s) oftheissues asidentified inChapter 3.1.Acounterfactual or‘do-nothing ’ option should also beincluded asameans ofcomparison, although itisnotconsidered asaspecific option in andofitself.4.1 Identify a range of intervention options 40Table 4: Types of policy instruments Include tools such as taxes, subsidies, fines and fees. They incentivise a change in behavior of economic agents to correct for market failure, for example: the over/under consumption or production of goods and services, or to achieve desired socio -economic outcomes.•Excise tax on cigarettes to incentivise reduced consumption to address associated negative externalities Laws, Emiri decrees, decisions of the Chairman of the Executive Council, decisions of the Executive Council, circulars, and executive and executive orders.•Laws that restrict the sale of tobacco products to under 18s Involves goods and services provided by the Government directly (such as infrastructure).

Thefollowing research approaches areuseful atthisstage :There aretwocore components toconsider when identifying potential policy options :thepolicy instrument and thepolicy scope. The aimofthisstep istothink broadly about thechallenge oropportunity andtoshow stakeholders thata variety ofoptions have been considered .Keyquestions toaskduring thisstep include :What could affect the drivers ofaproblem? What could influence behaviours inamanner thatwould address theproblem andhelp achieve thepolicy objectives? Responses tothese questions should identify asmany public policy intervention options aspossible, consider less intrusive instruments aswell asmore interventionist approaches, andconsider classical approaches as well asmore recent thinking (For example :behavioral economics) .Further considerations atthisstage may also include questions such as:How could theobjectives bereached through alternative policy approaches? If apolicy exists inthearea, could ‘doing less’improve theoutcome, orcould theoutcome beimproved through adjusting existing legislation?Forfurther details, guidance andinformation onthese research methods .Thefollowing steps canbeauseful waytoapproach options identification : Generate a wide variety of policy options, preferably using different policy instruments 4101Policy instrument :Policy instruments arethetools available tothegovernment tomake changes in order toachieve thedesired objectives .These tools canbegrouped intofourbroad categories .Table 4 describes some examples oftools andthegroups they fallinto. Policy scope :Thescope ofapublic policy identifies towhat, andtheextent towhich, anintervention willapply .This may include specifying thetarget population, industry sectors, geographic locations, products, services, businesses, orother criteria. Formore details and discussion onstakeholder assessments andmapping, Literature reviews :Reviewing academic papers, white papers orother theoretically -backed views that study different policies andtheir impact ; Benchmark studies: Examining themanifestation oftheproblem inother countries, theevolution of thechallenge andreviewing thelessons learned from elsewhere ;and Primary data collection :Gathering primary data from first-hand sources, such assurveys, interviews, focus groups orexperiments togenerate situation -specific insights . Example 1: Reduce consumption of harmful goodsExample 2: Attract foreign investmentThe aimofthisstep istofocus analysis onviable options andtoidentify andexclude options thatareless effective. Asthisisjustscreening, theexclusion ofoptions should beeasy tojustify .Forconsistency, itis recommended thatoptions arescreened in-linewith theFramework Appraisal Criteria, Thescreening criteria foreach option are: Answers tothese questions, particularly onfeasibility andimpact, canbehighly uncertain atthisstage andthe purpose here istoscreen -outunviable options from thelong-list.Theoutput ofthisstage willbeasub-listof policy options, such astheexample outlined inFigure 19.

Examples .2 Undertake a qualitative appraisal Most policy decisions involve choosing between alternative public policy intervention options andevaluating trade -offs.These trade -offsarehard toevaluate, duetotheir inherent complexity anduncertainty .Tomanage this, itisrecommended that policy -makers apply astructured assessment framework toanalyse proposed interventions across asetofdifferent appraisal criteria . Thelevels ofanalysis thatcanbeperformed oneach public policy intervention option include : Figure 20: Levels of supporting evidence at Pre -ApprovalDirectional :Ahigh-level qualitative assessment oftheexpected direction oftheimpact oneach assessment criteria (i.e.positive ornegative impact) ; Directional andmagnitudinal :Ahigh-level qualitative assessment ofthemagnitude ofthepositive or negative impact oneach assessment criteria (For example :high, medium orlowimpact) ; Qualitative QuantitativeDirectionalDirectional and magnitudinalBenchmarkSituation -specific analysisRobustnessEvidence required at this stage Level of supporting evidenceSituation -specific analysis :Aquantification oftheimpact based ondetailed analysis ofthe intervention using theEmirate ofAbuDhabi -specific data.Benchmarking :Aquantification oftheimpact based onsimilar interventions implemented innational orinternational benchmarks ;and Each criterion canbeassessed through different levels ofanalysis, ranging from high-level qualitative analysis based onconceptual logic and judgement, toin-depth quantitative analysis based onthespecific context . Figure 21again sets outtheappraisal criteria framework andcontains anon-exhaustive listofcriteria thatare frequently used inthepublic policy appraisal process . 44Itshould benoted thatqualitative assessments canbesubjective andprone tobias.Toaddress this, evidence based onbenchmarks and/or situation specific analysis may berequired atalater stage based onADEO ’s request .The level ofanalysis foreach public policy intervention willbedetermined indiscussion with ADEO during thePre-Approval stage . The appraisal ofpublic policy interventions should bebased onthethree assessment areas discussed on page 42.These arediscussed infurther detail below : Strategic fit:These criteria areused toassess thealignment oftheproposed public policy intervention with wider strategic considerations .The assessment criteria include different levels ofgovernment, as wellasthemandate oftherequesting entity inquestion . Feasibility :These criteria areused toassess thepracticality ofaproposed public policy intervention through analysis ofitslegal, financial, technical and organisational requirements .Analysis ofthese criteria isused toidentify thestrengths andweaknesses ofeach option and, when combined with an assessment oftheimpact, can beused tounderstand thecost-effectiveness ofapublic policy intervention . Impact :These criteria areused todetermine theexpected impact ofaproposed public policy intervention across arange ofeconomic, social andenvironmental factors .Analysis ofthese criteria, or other impact metrics asappropriate, isused tounderstand thepositive and negative impacts ofthe proposed intervention onsociety asawhole .

Theremainder ofthissub-chapter provides anintroduction tosome ofthecore concepts used intheappraisal process, drawing onMCA andother techniques : 1.Select theappraisal criteria 2.Determine theweighting ofeach appraisal criterion 3.Determine thelevel ofanalysis 4.Assess strategic fitandfeasibility 5.Assess impact 6.Assign scores 7.Normalise andselect thepreferred option(s) Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis 4601 02 03Requesting entities may opttoapply adifferent qualitative assessment methodology but,even ifthisisthe case, theguidance contained within thissub-chapter remains highly relevant . Select theappraisal criteria Thefirststep inqualitatively assessing theproposed options istoidentify theappropriate appraisal criteria, as these willdefine thebasis onwhich each option willbeassessed . The selected criteria willdepend onthenature oftheintervention, aswell asthepriorities ofthedecision makers .Itcanbebeneficial toconsult stakeholders atthisstage, astheinclusion ofappraisal criteria thatare aligned withstakeholders' objectives canhelp generate buy-inandsupport . Determine theweighting ofeach appraisal criterion Qualitative analysis requires reaching aconclusion onthebasis ofheterogeneous criteria .InanMCA, weights areassigned toeach criterion toallow forgreater emphasis tobeplaced onthose thatareofparticular interest topolicy -makers .Equal weighting isthedefault setting . Stakeholders canbeconsulted atthisstage toensure that both theassessment criteria and weights are reflective ofthepotential impacts ofthepublic policy intervention .Their involvement canhelp setrealistic expectations onwhat anintervention canachieve . Determine thelevel ofanalysis Aspreviously discussed onpage 44,each criterion can beassessed through different levels ofanalysis ranging from high-level qualitative analysis based onconceptual logic andjudgement, toin-depth quantitative analysis based onthespecific context . The levels ofanalysis thatcanbeperformed oneach ofthepotential options include directional, directional andmagnitudinal, benchmarking, andsituation -specific analysis . Building ontheanalysis conducted aspart oftheAgenda Setting stage, thestrategic appraisal criteria are designed tounderstand thecase forchange while determining alignment with wider strategic considerations . Thestrategic assessment isdriven bythefollowing three criteria : The combination ofthestrategic and feasibility assessments enables policy -makers todistinguish between options onthebasis oftheir ability toefficiently achieve specific objectives while furthering wider goals . 47Alignment with vision and strategy :Assess how theproposed intervention supports theexisting strategies oftheUAE, theEmirate ofAbu Dhabi andtherequesting entity .Itisimportant toidentify if theproposed intervention willfurther orundermine existing strategic objectives, aswellastoconsider interdependencies between different levels ofgovernment . Alignment with objectives :Analyse how likely theproposed public policy intervention istomeet the desired objective(s), output(s) oroutcome(s) thattheintervention aims toachieve . National security :Analyse theimpact ofthepublic policy intervention onnational security . Legal feasibility :Assess how easy anintervention istoimplement .Where therequesting entity is uncertain oftheimplications, theappropriate legal department(s) should beconsulted . Technical feasibility :Assess whether theintervention canbedelivered with existing technical and technological capabilities, orwhether additional resources arerequired . Organisational capabilities :Assess whether the intervention can bedelivered within existing organisational structures . Stakeholder engagement :Assess whether there iswider stakeholder support fortheproposed intervention .Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Assess strategic fit and feasibility 04 Cost :Assess theimplications oftheintervention ongovernment finances .Consideration should be given toexisting organisational budgets, theavailability ofadditional budget and thebudgetary implications forother entities. This willrequire robust estimates ofthefiscal implications ofthe proposed intervention . Federal implications :Identify whether theEmirate ofAbu Dhabi hastheauthority andcapability to implement theproposed intervention . When qualitatively assessing theimpact ofapublic policy intervention, itisimportant toremember that impacts should always beassessed inrelation tothecounterfactual, orbusiness asusual scenario .Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Assess impact Figure 22: Impact pathway Animpact pathway articulates causal chains through aseries of‘if-then’statements ateach step, andisaprocess ofreflection about how andwhy change isexpected tohappen asaresult ofa public policy intervention . 4805 What is the public policy intervention? Public policy intervention What stakeholders are impacted by this policy? What is the behavioural change of these stakeholders in response to this policy? What are the consequences of this behavioural response? What is the impact on indicators of interest?Stakeholder(s)Behavioral changeConsequence(s)Impact Auseful toolforassessing different public policy interventions against theimpact criteria isanimpact pathway (Figure 22).Interventions, bydesign, aredeveloped toinduce achange inbehaviour foraspecific stakeholder group .This change inbehaviour cantrigger areaction chain dependent ontheinteractions between different stakeholder groups, which willultimately generate impacts across economic, environmental and social dimensions . Impact pathways areatoolwhich canbeused tounderstand thepotential chains ofresponse thatresult from different interventions andthey canalso help identify thedifferent channels through which each intervention canhave impact .They should capture both thedirect andintended impacts ofanintervention, aswellasany potential indirect andunintended impacts . Impact pathways canbedeveloped based onvarious sources ofinformation : Economic theory and logic tounderstand thetheoretical channels ofimpact that aproposed public policy intervention may have . Literature review tounderstand thepotential impact channel ofanintervention, based onthe experiences from similar interventions implemented inother jurisdictions . Engagement with stakeholders tounderstand thespecific expected implications ofproposed interventions inthecontext oftheEmirate ofAbuDhabi . Tohelp assess themagnitude ofanintervention ’simpact, several considerations should beassessed, which arelisted inTable 5.This listisnon-exhaustive, andrequesting entities should consider whether there are further elements they should addthatarespecific totheareas inwhich they areworking. Itshould benoted thatthese provide guidance only onthepotential magnitude andwillvary onacase -by-case basis. Aspart oftherequest forPre-Approval, only aqualitative assessment ofeach option against theappraisal criteria isrequired .Thequalitative assessment looks atthedirection andmagnitude ofeach option ’seffect on each ofthecriteria .Inallcases, commentary and/or evidence should beprovided toexplain thequalitative score .Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Assign scores Figure 23shows aworked example ofanimpact pathway .

For example, depending on the specific case, fiscal instruments may be expected to generate larger changes in behaviour than information provision resulting in larger overall impacts. Scope of interventionThe scope of a potential intervention identifies stakeholders who will be targeted, and the geographical location in which the proposed intervention will apply. Typically, a policy that targets a larger stakeholder group or geographical location would be expected to generate a larger impact. Duration of interventionIn some cases, the direct effect of an intervention on the criteria may be positive, whilst the indirect effects are negative. For example, an intervention may increase employment in one sector but decrease it in another. In this case, the overall effect should be used to determine the direction of impact. Likelihood of impact occurringSome impacts are more certain to occur than others. MCA provides aconsistent and standardised means ofcomparing options. The final scores calculated can therefore becompared tohelp select thepreferred option(s) .Note thattheoverall score should notbetheonly consideration when selecting apreferred option ;each option should bereviewed holistically based onall evidence gathered . Insome cases, more than oneoption may betaken forward .Therequest forPre-Approval should, under most circumstances, include nomore than three preferred option(s) including :Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Normalise and select the preferred option(s) Incases where there isaclear preferred option withasignificantly higher MCA score compared toalltheother assessed options, alternative options may notberequired .This should bedetermined through discussions withADEO . Thenext step istodesign thepreferred option(s) atahigh-level, asthisispartoftherequest forPre-Approval . This step revisits thetwocomponents defined inChapter 4.1(policy instrument and scope), and defines additional design elements depending onthenature ofthepolicy and thepolicy instrument .Fordifferent instruments thismay cover, forexample :4.3 Develop high -level design 5107 Thepreferred option :Generally theoption withthehighest overall score ;and, Alternative options :Uptotwoalternative options withthenext highest overall scores .

Analysis conducted atthisstage willrequire agreater level ofrigour compared tothehigh-level qualitative assessment described inChapter 4.2.Theadditional request willgenerally askforquantified evidence relating tooneormore oftheappraisal criteria and/or further details oncertain aspects oftheproposal . Incases where theproposed budget fortheintervention islow, isexpected tohave asmall orlimited impact, orisconsidered toberelatively lowrisk, abenchmarking analysis based onsimilar policies inleading jurisdictions may besufficient toprovide insight intothepotential impacts oftheintervention . Inother cases, therequest may beforspecific analysis tobeconducted inthecontext oftheEmirate ofAbu Dhabi toquantitatively estimate theimpacts .This willtypically require more advanced analytical techniques, such asImpact Assessment (IA)andSocial Cost Benefit Analysis (S-CBA), which help quantify estimates of thepotential direct and indirect impacts ofpublic policy interventions .There may also besubject -matter specific methodologies thatcanbeapplied byrequesting entities toquantitatively assess different options .4.4 Undertake a quantitative appraisal Figure 25: Levels of supporting evidence at Final Approval (optional) DirectionalBenchmarkSituation -specific analysis Level of supporting evidenceRobustnessEvidence required at this stage Qualitative QuantitativeDirectional and magnitudinal *This step is only required if further evidence is requested after Pre -Approval* 55The results ofanyanalysis canbeused toupdate theMCA that was previously completed aspart ofthe request forPre-Approval .The MCA can combine this new quantitative evidence with thequalitative assessment that was undertaken earlier inthedevelopment process .The remainder ofthissub-chapter introduces different quantification techniques andfurther guidance torequesting entities onhow toproceed . Quantification involves using arange oftechniques toestimate thesize oftheimpacts ofaproposed public policy intervention .This canhelp compare different options, assess whether anoption isworth pursuing, and make effective decisions about public spending .More detailed guidance onhow tomeasure, quantify and compare different types ofimpact iscovered later inthischapter . Quantification always adds rigour totheanalysis provided insupport ofapublic policy intervention .This provides increased confidence andenables effective decision -making .Forexample, rather than justknowing thatanexercise programme inschools islikely todecrease obesity levels amongst children, itishelpful to know byhow much thelevels arelikely todecrease, sothatitcanbecompared totheimpacts ofadifferent policy, such asasugar tax.However, itisnotalways possible toquantify allimpacts, often duetoconstraints ontime andresources . Thequantification ofimpacts should bedone through thefollowing steps: 1.Generate alistofpotential impacts 2.Prioritise impacts forquantification 3.Select indicators tomeasure theimpact 4.Collect data 5.Design quantification methodology 6.Conduct analysis 7.Document andreport results Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Generate a list of potential impacts The impacts oftheintervention should already bewell understood atthisstage, based ontheprevious qualitative analysis .However, itisimportant torevisit theimpact pathway toseeifanyupdates need tobe made inlight ofrecent changes tothe proposed intervention orsuggestions from Pre-Approval or stakeholders .01 *This step is only required if further evidence is requested after Pre -Approval* 56Figure 26: Materiality assessment The magnitude of impact can be assessed by looking at variables such as: •The economic sector(s) affected; •The number of people affected; •The area affected (for example, the city); •The size of impact on the sector/people/ area; •The duration of impact The importance can be assessed by considering: •Political importance; •Social importance; •Cultural importance; •Importance to key stakeholders (including requests from ADEO to quantify a particular impact) Importance of impact Estimated magnitude of impactMedium to high materialityHigh materiality No or low materialityMedium to high materialityInpractice, itwillrarely benecessary tomeasure alloftheimpacts created byapublic policy intervention as thiscould require considerable time and resource .Itistherefore important tofocus onthecore costs and benefits that areassociated with aproposal .These areusually themost significant impacts and theones which aremost important torelevant stakeholders . The process ofidentifying these isknown asamateriality assessment, andissummarised inFigure 26..A materiality assessment focuses onplotting each impact across twoaxes soastocompare theimportance and magnitude oftheeffects .Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Prioritise impacts for quantification 02 Once themost material impacts have been selected, theindicator(s) which willbeused toquantify them must beidentified .Forexample, toquantify theimpact ofaschool exercise programme, thereduction inincidence ofobesity amongst school children might beanappropriate indicator . Good indicators willaccount for: •How widely theimpacts arefelt;and •How much each stakeholder isaffected .Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Select indicators to measure impact 03 theEmirate ofAbu Dhabi -specific data tocontextualise thelikely impacts :This may include :demographic data, data about thestructure oftheEmirate ofAbu Dhabi economy (forexample :size ofsectors, keytrading partners, employment data), social factors (forexample :disease prevalence, education levels), environmental factors (forexample :airpollution levels) ordata related toaparticular industry (forexample :number ofannual visitors, revenue peravailable hotel room) . Depending onthenature oftherequest forfurther analysis, itmay besufficient tosubmit thequalitative data to ADEO atthispoint (see Figure 25).This isbecause benchmarks and/or data from theliterature cangive a useful indication ofthelikely impact intheEmirate ofAbuDhabi even without further analysis. Inthiscase, theMCA conducted fortherequest forPre-Approval should beupdated toincorporate the benchmark data thathasbeen collected. This allows forintervention options tobecompared alongside the other qualitative considerations (forexample :feasibility and impacts with lowmateriality) toselect between options .Inother cases, however, there may bearequest thatdata isfurther analysed toprovide asituation - specific estimate oflikely impacts inanAbuDhabi context . Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Design quantification methodology There aremany different types ofquantification techniques andanumber ofthese areoutlined inthisnext step.Different techniques willbeappropriate fordifferent circumstances, andrequesting entities willneed to exercise judgement onwhat isboth proportionate andappropriate fortheintervention inquestion .The best approach tousewillbedependent onthepolicy being appraised, andthetype ofimpacts being considered .*This step is only required if further evidence is requested after Pre -Approval* 5705Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Collect data Thenext step intheassessment istocollect thedata thatwillbeused tomeasure theidentified impacts .The specific data needed willdepend onthespecific intervention, butislikely toinclude : Data about thelikely impacts ofaproposal :This canbefound through:04 Literature review :Looking atstudies oftheimpacts ofdifferent interventions ; Benchmarking :Review ofother jurisdictions ororganisations who have implemented asimilar proposal elsewhere intheUAE orglobally ;and Primary data collection: Forexample, interviewing keystakeholders, undertaking surveys, pilots, focus groups orexperiments . *This step is only required if further evidence is requested after Pre -Approval* 58Itcan behelpful touse theimpact pathway developed fortherequest forPre-Approval todesign a quantification approach .Each stage canbequantified separately, andtheresults combined toestimate the overall impact .Where animpact pathway hasmultiple branches, separate calculations should beconsidered foreach branch.

When quantifying the impacts of a public policy intervention, it is important to remember that impacts should always be measured in relation to the counterfactual. This is the scenario which would have occurred if the intervention had not been put in place, and the world had continued with business as usual (BAU). Impact should always be compared to the counterfactual to avoid overstating or understating the potential impact.*This step is only required if further evidence is requested after Pre -Approval* *This step is only required if further evidence is requested after Pre -Approval* There areanumber ofother considerations which should also betaken into account when conducting quantitative analysis .These aresetoutinmore detail Figures 30and31. Figure 30: Making and logging assumptions Quantitative analysis usually involves making several assumptions. These may include: These should be clearly documented in an assumptions tracker, with ratings or commentary to indicate how likely the assumptions are to be true, and how large an impact they will have on the results. An example assumptions tracker is provided below: # DescriptionHow likely is the assumption to be true?How significant is the assumption to the overall result? 1Price elasticity of demand for sugary drinksM H 2Time and resources to comply with administrative requestsH L 3 Expected rate of compliance M LAssumptions on the nature of the proposed intervention; Assumptions in any primary data collection; Assumptions in any studies used from literature; Assumptions in any adjustments made to apply the data to the proposed intervention; Assumptions to account for unknown data; Assumption on time -span or duration of intervention; and, Methodological assumptions 61 Figure 31: Accounting for uncertainty *This step is only required if further evidence is requested after Pre -Approval* How certain isitthat thisimpact willoccur? Inpractice, itisusually impossible toprovide aflawless prediction ofthemagnitude oftheimpact ofa public policy intervention .Itistherefore important toprovide anindication ofthelevel ofconfidence in theresults .Forexample, thiscould depend on: Wherever possible, itisimportant toprovide anindication ofconfidence inanyquantitative analysis .This may bedone by: Providing aqualitative rating (forexample :high/medium/low, withanexplanation) Providing ranges (asmaller range usually indicates ahigher confidence level) Using statistical techniques (forexample :95% confidence intervals)The quantification techniques used (for example :high-level/advanced, primary/secondary data collection andsample size) Thereliability ofanystudies/models used intheanalysis The relevance ofany studies/models used (for example :Emirate ofAbu Dhabi -based, Gulf Cooperation Council benchmark, international benchmark, and thenumber and type ofsurvey respondents) Thelevel ofdetail oftheanalysis Screen the initial -list of options into a longlist for further design and analysis Document and report results Finally, theresults ofany quantitative analysis should beclearly documented and submitted alongside the updated MCA .The results should bereported inaclear, informative way sothatthey canbeunderstood by people who have notbeen involved intheassessment process uptothispoint .Theresults should include : Description of the proposed public policy intervention Details on the primary data collected Details covering any wider studies and reports used Information covering adjustments/quantitative analysis Confidence levels The main results (estimates of potential impact(s)) Key assumptions (including the assumptions tracker) Any further resources that were used Itisoften helpful forresults tobepresented visually, using graphs anddiagrams .After Pre-Approval, theMCA conducted fortherequest can then beupdated toincorporate thequantified impacts estimated using environmental impact assessment (EIA), S-CBA orother methodologies .This allows forthem tobecompared alongside other considerations thathave been assessed qualitatively .The results oftheMCA and supporting evidence (including thereport above) should then besubmitted forreview andapproval . 6207 .5 Develop detailed design The final step intheprocess before re-submitting forFinal Approval istodevelop thedetailed design forthe preferred option, which happens through 3steps: 1.Finalise thedetailed design ofthepreferred policy option 2.Finalise theimplementation plan 3.Produce amonitoring andevaluation plan The remainder ofthischapter focusses oneach ofthese components inturn and provides further advice, guidance andsupport torequesting entities onhow toproduce each ofthem . Finalise the detailed design of preferred policy option This step builds onthecomponents identified inChapter 4.3toprovide additional detail onthefinal design ofthe preferred policy option .Figure 32illustrates how thehigh-level design from thePre-Approval request is expanded forthepreferred policy option using theexamples oftaxandregulatory policies discussed earlier in thismanual (please seeChapters 4.1and4.3). Finalise the Implementation Plan Theintervention design provided intherequest forPre-Approval should besupplemented withadditional details toallow foracommon understanding across allthestakeholders thatwillbeinvolved intheimplementation of thepolicy .Asaminimum, thismust include: Clearly defined objectives including detail on: •Indicators thatwillbeused tomeasure theeffectiveness ofthepolicy, toinclude :methods forcollecting therequired data;targets (value orlevel) tobeachieved within specific timeframes ;and abaseline against which theperformance willbecompared •Frequency andtimeframe forcollecting andreporting information Well-articulated description ofstakeholders, regions, exemptions, andother details towhich thepolicy willor willnotapply .

This step involves identifying themain activities tobecompleted aspartofimplementing thepreferred option, including estimating therequired time tocomplete each activity andindicating theproposed ‘owner ’oreach . Key activities should also bebroken down intosmaller tasks tosupport implementation andreview .Relevant stakeholders should beengaged tosetclear roles andresponsibilities against theidentified tasks, andtoreview therequirements needed forimplementation. This should include : •Milestones :anachievement thatreflects theprogress ofaspecific task; •Dependencies :identified links between activities where theinitiation orcompletion ofatask ormilestone relies onthecompletion orachievement ofanother task ormilestone ; •Duration :time required tocomplete each task, andexpected start andenddates ; •Owners and supporting entities :parties accountable and/or responsible forcompleting therelevant task (aResponsibility Assignment Matrix [RACI Matrix]) can beused asatool toallocate roles and responsibilities :asillustrated inFigure 33). Based ontheactivities identified, theimplementation requirements forthepreferred option should beidentified . Thepotential requirements thatneed tobeconsidered willdepend onthepublic policy intervention inquestion, butfurther guidance isprovided inTable 6.Activities and milestones Implementation requirements Type of requirement Description Administrative Requirements for changes in organisational structures, operations, or procedures Resource Requirements for human capital to fill a capacity, capability, or competency gap Technical Requirements for new or updated infrastructure, materials, systems, or equipment FinancialRequirements for budget to fund the implementation including: •Capital expenditure requirements: Upfront capital investments to implement the intervention such as vehicles, buildings and infrastructure investment. •Operating expenditure requirements: Any operational and maintenance requirements over the expected lifetime of the intervention or over a given time horizon, such as wages, office supplies and maintenance.

Once implementation risks have been identified, adetailed assessment ofthese risks isrequired .This canbe achieved byassessing thelikelihood andimpact oftherisks andthepotential mechanisms toavoid, minimise andmanage them .Risk owners should also beidentified andbriefed .Implementation risks and mitigants Engaging stakeholders atthisstage canhelp identify risks andsupport inthedesign ofappropriate mitigation strategies .Stakeholders can pinpoint how certain choices made atthis point can lead tounintended consequences later intheprocess andpropose themost effective mitigation strategy . Produce a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan Once theimplementation plan isinplace, isitimportant todevelop aplan onhow thesuccess ofthepolicy will bemonitored andevaluated across different dimensions ofinterest .Ataminimum, theMonitoring andEvaluation plan should cover thefollowing fourdimensions (further advice onhow toproduce these plans canalso befound intheBusiness Case Template ): •Dimensions ofinterest ; •Data collection plan; •Data analysis plan;and •Reporting . 6703 This covers thevarious angles from which anintervention canbemonitored andevaluated .This may include, butisnotlimited to,thefollowing : Foreach oftheselected dimensions, itisimportant todefine adata collection plan which canbetracked and followed when monitoring theprogress ofthepublic policy intervention .Stakeholders should keep inmind that new data reporting requirements present administrative costs andshould becarefully assessed andavoided where possible .Relevance focuses onassessing theextent towhich theobjectives anddesign stillmeet theneeds and problems itsought toaddress .This requires reviewing theimportance oftheintervention byreassessing itsusefulness intackling theidentified problem atthetime oftheevaluation (future state) .Astime goes by,theoverall circumstances may have changed andhence theinitially identified problems may also have changed compared towhen thepolicy wasinitially designed .Analysing anymisalignment between theneed atthetime oftheevaluation and thepolicy objectives would support inidentifying the relevance ofthepolicy being assessed ; Effectiveness links thepublic policy intervention toitsdesired objectives byassessing thesuccess of theintervention inachieving orprogressing towards these goals .The objectives defined during the Agenda Setting stage canbeused asKPIs ; Efficiency weighs thecosts being incurred bythepublic policy intervention andtheactual change ithas achieved. This canbeassessed using acost-benefit analysis ofthecosts thathave resulted from the public policy intervention and comparing these totheactual changes ithasledto(changes canbe positive ornegative) ;and, Impact, oradded value, assesses theactual impacts against those estimated during theappraisal stage ofthepolicy development cycle .Exceeding theestimated positive impacts (benefits) isconsidered a success, while exceeding negative impacts (costs) would suggest thatthey were likely underestimated during thepolicy development cycle .Dimensions of interest Data collection plan This should cover, butisnotlimited to,thefollowing areas : 1.Indicators :these represent thecriteria against which thepublic policy intervention willbeassessed .For example, ifweconsider effectiveness asthedimension offocus, indicators would include thepredefined KPIs against which thepolicy objectives willbeassessed ; 2.Source ofdata:These arethedifferent sources ofdata required toquantify thepredefined indicators ; and, 3.Method and frequency ofdata collection :This willcover thedifferent ways tocollect therequired data (forexample, online surveys) aswellasthefrequency atwhich thisdata willbecollected. This laststep oftheMonitoring andEvaluation plan should cover thefollowing three important areas : •Type ofreporting :This refers tothepurpose ofthereporting .The main distinction isbetween progress updates, orother reports formanagement, andevaluations oftheintervention ; •Target audience :Thereceiving party ortheenduser oftheevaluation report .Theaudience canbeinternal (within therequesting entity) orexternal (other departments ortheAbu Dhabi Executive Office) ora combination ofboth;and, •Frequency ofreporting :The frequency ofreporting canbebased onthetarget audience. Forinstance, reporting within therequesting entity (internally) might need tobemore frequent (forexample, monthly) as opposed toreporting toADEO (forexample, semi -annually) . The useofmonitoring and evaluation techniques requires training and experience, and policy -makers from requesting entities should seek advice andguidance from therelevant analytical andeconomic teams within their entity ifthey need further support .ADEO willalso beable toadvise ontheprecise requirements where necessary . 68Final ApprovalOnce arequesting entity has completed thesteps inChapter 4.5and filled inthe corresponding sections oftheBusiness Case Template, they should submit thetemplate, along withanynecessary supporting documents, forFinal Approval .Submit for Final ApprovalInthisstep, therequesting entity willdescribe themethods and techniques ofanalysis they willadopt to evaluate thepublic policy intervention against each ofthedefined dimensions .Further information forhow to complete thisplan canbefound intheBusiness Case Template .Data analysis plan Reporting ✓ Stakeholder Engagement ChecklistFinal Approval Checklist Complete the detailed design of the preferred policy option Complete a detailed Implementation Plan for the preferred option Develop a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan for the preferred option Submit the updated Business Case Template to ADEO for Final Approval Consider the amount of time stakeholders will need to communicate within their organisation about the capacity and resources needed to deliver the policy intervention Seek stakeholder input on the implementation plan, and agree on a defined list of roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder Prepare list of stakeholder requirements for implementation Inform identified contacts of their specific roles and responsibilities, and agree on a timetable for the communication plans Inform key stakeholders about the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan and seek agreement as necessary 69 Chapter 5: Implement Chapter 5: Implement The Implement stage ofthe Public Policy Cycle aims toensure the efficient and successful implementation ofpublic policy interventions .Most oftheadvice, guidance andsupport onpolicy and project management willbespecific toeach requesting entity and these entities should ensure that the relevant sectors and teams within their organisation aresufficiently informed and involved throughout implementation . There aretwoparts tothisshort chapter :thefirstprovides high-level guidance onhow toprepare forthe launch ofapublic policy intervention ;thesecond provides advice andguidance forrequesting entities once thepolicy islive. 5.1 Prepare for policy implementation This step focuses oncompleting allthetasks that canassist inenabling implementation ofthepublic policy intervention .Itisrecommended tofulfill allofthefollowing tasks prior totheofficial launch ofanyintervention, andadditional tasks may also berequired depending onthedesign ofthespecific public policy inquestion: 71 ADEO Interaction (* = indicates mandatory step) Figure 35: Implement stage overview Stage of the Public Policy Cycle 1 Agenda setting 3 Implement 4 Monitor and evaluate2 Design and appraise ReportingHow do we launch the policy? Launch and execute the policy 3.2Prepare for policy implementation 3.1 •Communicate with stakeholders :Public policy interventions generally require participation from several different stakeholders, anditisimportant toalign with these organisations early intheprocess toensure thesuccessful implementation ofanyintervention. This includes internal communications within theentity, andexternal communications with other organisations, theprivate sector and, where necessary, citizens andconsumers .Allstakeholder maps should also bereviewed alongside thefinal implementation plan, andanynew stakeholders should bemade aware oftheir roleandhow thepolicy may affect them ; •Raise public awareness :One ofthebiggest risks thatcould cause issues during implementation isthe absence ofacommon understanding amongst thegeneral public ontheupcoming changes .Assuch, developing aninformation and/or marketing plan toraise awareness within therelevant communities in advance ofthelaunch ofthepolicy isvital; •Establish policy governance :Some policies may require theformation ofcommittees, while others may require theformation ofateam, sector, ordepartment .Regardless ofwhat therequirement is,forming the governance required forimplementation must becovered before thepublic policy intervention islaunched ; and •Deliver and confirm implementation requirements :Allrequirements identified forthepre-launch stage willbecompleted toensure effective implementation .This includes theallocation ofbudget andfinance andtheprovision ofadditional resources andskills .This may also involve tasks likeobtaining proposals from vendors orsuppliers . 5.2 Launch and execute the policy The approved option should bedelivered inaccordance with theimplementation plan, themonitoring and evaluation plan, andanyriskmitigation plans thathave been created .These plans areallcovered inmore detail inearlier parts ofthismanual . 72The risks identified during theDesign and Appraise stage willneed tobemanaged once apublic policy intervention isimplemented, and risk registers and risk cards should bemade available toallkey stakeholders responsible forimplementation. Theimplementation plan should have considered how best to mitigate these risks, andatthisstage those who aretasked withdelivery should have robust plans inplace . Once thepublic policy intervention islaunched, itsdelivery should beclearly announced and actively monitored .This enables improved functioning and data tracking oftheintervention, which iscritical to conducting arobust, detailed evaluation attheappropriate time.There areseveral ways thatthiscanbe done, andfurther information isprovided inChapter 6.Managing risks Monitoring performance Aspart oftheimplementation, entities should provide update reports torelevant stakeholders onaregular basis.Reporting Reporting ✓ Stakeholder Engagement ChecklistImplement Stage Checklist Communicate the public policy intervention to all stakeholders to prepare them for implementation Announce any changes that impact the intervention and raise awareness of any actions required Provide all the requirements necessary for the successful implementation of the intervention (administrative, resourcing, technical, and financial requirements) Execute the public policy intervention in line with the implementation plan Issue formal, written communications to all relevant departments and stakeholders to prepare them for implementation Provide ongoing support to stakeholders as needs arise Consider setting up regular check -ins with stakeholders to monitor progress and resolve any unexpected challenges 73 Chapter 6: Monitor and evaluate Chapter 6: Monitor and evaluate 75The implementation ofapublic policy intervention does notmark theend ofthePublic Policy Cycle .Once introduced, itisimportant tomonitor theeffects thepolicy ishaving and, attheright time, evaluate itsoverall impact .Asthefourth and final step inthePublic Policy Cycle, itisintended toprovide policy -makers with objective analysis andinsights toinform future decision -making . Within thePublic Policy Cycle, monitoring and evaluation have distinct butinterrelated roles (Figure 37). Broadly speaking, monitoring isacontinuous process, while fullevaluations take place atkeymilestones. Figure 36: Monitor and evaluate stage overview Stage of the Public Policy Cycle ADEO Interaction (* = indicates mandatory step) 1 Agenda setting 3 Implement 4 Monitor and evaluate2 Design and appraise EvaluationHow do we ensure this is still the best way? Evaluate the policy 4.2Monitor policy implementation 4.1 Figure 37: Monitor and Evaluate goals Monitor: this involves the frequent collection of data related to the intervention and can be used to assess progress. Monitoring sets the foundation on which an evaluation can take place, as proper evaluation is reliant on adequate data and information. Evaluate: adetailed public policy assessment uses theavailable information toexamine apolicy ’sdesign, functionality andability to meet itsobjectives andoutputs .Together, monitoring and evaluation activities assess the key aspects of any policy intervention, and are ultimately used to determine how successful the policy intervention has been, and what improvements can be made. The remainder ofthischapter willprovide advice, guidance andanoverview ofdifferent tools andtechniques thatcanbeused tosupport policy -makers intheir monitoring andevaluation activity .Thechapter issplitintotwo core parts : 1. Monitor Policy Implementation 2. Evaluate thePolicy Before designing amonitoring andevaluation strategy, itisimportant toconsider itspurpose andimportance for thewider Public Policy Cycle .This helps toprovide aframework onwhich toplan thespecific monitoring and evaluation activities that need totake place and ensures thatthey areadapted tothespecifics ofthepolicy intervention being assessed . Why is public policy evaluation important? 01 Evaluating public policy interventions isavital partofthedevelopment process because itallows policy -makers andthewider public tounderstand theimpacts ofchanges andallows thelessons learned tobeentered intothe evidence base used todevelop future policies .Astrong public policy evaluation programme results intwokey outcomes :improved learning andincreased accountability . Learning :Through monitoring and evaluation, policy makers can gauge whether theimplemented intervention isproducing theimpacts that itwas forecast to.Intheearly stages ofapolicy ’s implementation, learning canhelp adapt thepolicy ’sdesign toimprove itsfunctionality andperformance . Insome cases, pilots ofapublic policy intervention areheld totestthepolicy ’sdesign inacontrolled setting, andthelearnings from thepilot caninform itsdevelopment forlarger scale interventions .Itis important totake learnings from both successful andunsuccessful interventions, asboth provide insights which canbeuseful forfuture interventions . Accountability :Evaluating public policy helps tohold thegovernment andpublic sector toaccount for thechanges thatthey have made .This includes ensuring thatgovernment money isspent inaprudent and transparent manner, and that policies deliver theresults that they have were designed to.By evaluating theresults ofanintervention, thegovernment candemonstrate thatitisacting inthepublic interest and informing thepublic oftheresults itisachieving .This helps tobuild trust between government andthepublic andcanhelp improve compliance ifthepublic iswellinformed ofthepurpose andresults ofaparticular initiative. What is a successful public policy evaluation? 02 Asuccessful public policy evaluation results inaholistic assessment ofanintervention ’seffects, andoutlines what canbelearned from itsdesign andimplementation .Inorder todevelop thisassessment, anintervention should bemonitored throughout itsimplementation, from early stages tothepoint theevaluation takes place . Effective monitoring and evaluation should provide insights across several stages oftheintervention ’slogic model (Figure 38). Figure 38: Impact evaluation Effective monitoring and evaluation should assess different dimensions oftheintervention .There aremany different potential dimensions, and policy -makers should select those that aremost relevant totheir specific policy, butallevaluations intheEmirate ofAbuDhabi should include atleast thefollowing : 77Outputs ActivitiesInputs Inputs InputsOutcomes Outcomes Outcomes Inputs : Resources that feed into the policy ’s activities or processes, and are generally straightforward and easy to identify, such as financials, employees, equipment, systemsActivities: Actions, activities, or processes undertaken as part of the policy ’s implementation. Outputs: The products, services or capital goods that result from an intervention, such as number of families who attended an awareness programme, or number of households that have been visitedOutcomes: The expected effects of an intervention's outputs. Typically, observable and measurable indicators to measure progress, and that have predefined targets to determine desired levels (For example: % reduction in smoking) Relevance focuses onassessing theextent towhich theobjectives anddesign stillmeet theneeds and problems itsought toaddress .This requires reviewing theimportance oftheintervention byreassessing itsusefulness intackling theidentified problem atthetime oftheevaluation (future state) .Astime goes by,theoverall circumstances may have changed andhence theinitially identified problems may also have changed ascompared towhen thepolicy was initially designed .Analysing any misalignment between theneed atthetime oftheevaluation andthepolicy objectives would support inidentifying the relevance ofthepolicy being assessed ; Effectiveness links thepublic policy intervention toitsdesired objectives byassessing thesuccess of theintervention inachieving orprogressing towards these goals .The objectives defined during the Agenda Setting stage canbeused asKPIs ; Efficiency weighs thecosts being incurred bythepublic policy intervention andtheactual change ithas achieved .This canbeassessed using acost-benefit analysis ofthecosts thathave resulted from the public policy intervention andcomparing these tothechanges ithasactually ledto(changes canbe positive ornegative) ;and, Impact, oradded value, assesses theactual impacts against those estimated during theappraisal stage ofthepolicy development cycle .Exceeding theestimated positive impacts (benefits) isconsidered a success, while exceeding negative impacts (costs) would reveal that they were potentially underestimated during thepolicy development cycle . Forexample, some keyquestions apublic policy evaluation cananswer are: ●How istheintervention operating inpractice compared tohow itwasdesigned tooperate? ●Which groups aremost affected bytheintervention, andwhich groups areleast affected? ●Isthepolicy delivering within budget? ●How aretheimpacts oftheintervention feltacross different stakeholders? ●What improvements can bemade tohelp the policy deliver better results ormitigate unintended consequences? Every monitoring andevaluation strategy should consider both thestages anddimensions oftheintervention anditsintended impacts when framing thestrategy .Allother parts ofthestrategy anddata requirements will flow from aclear understanding ofwhat success looks likefortheintervention ateach stage andacross each dimension . Monitoring apublic policy intervention sets thefoundation onwhich evaluation can take place, asproper evaluation isreliant onadequate data and robust information .One oftheaims ofthemonitoring step isto examine what changes have occurred since theimplementation ofanintervention. Itisgenerally recommended torecord thefollowing aspects : •Implementation :how closely theimplementation plan (asdeveloped during theDesign andAppraise stage) wasfollowed; •Application :theextent towhich thepolicy met itsobjectives and theways inwhich theintervention has triggered change ; •Compliance andenforcement :level ofcompliance bystakeholders involved ;and •Contextual information :additional information that may notbedirectly related totheintervention but provides wider context (forexample :economic growth andnew technologies) . There areseveral important steps that need tobefollowed toensure that apublic policy intervention is monitored effectively, andtoensure thatthecorrect data areavailable fortheevaluation .These aresetoutin more detail below .6.1 Monitor policy implementation Develop a plan early 01 Developing aplan tomonitor apublic policy intervention early intheintervention ’sdevelopment isessential toa successful evaluation .Amonitoring plan should bealigned with theobjectives ofapublic policy intervention, so thatthedata thatiscollected isrelevant totheintervention ’sstated goals .Further information onthese plans is available inChapter 5. Set data requirements 02 Itisessential togather baseline data before apolicy intervention isimplemented, sothat theeffects ofthe intervention canbemeasured against historic performance before theintervention took place .This allows policy makers tocompare data andperformance measures ofthenew policy intervention with past results, tomeasure theimpact theintervention hadcompared toaworld inwhich itdidnottake place . Figure 39: General data types Qualitative Data This refers to data that is descriptive, and is collected through methods like interviews, observations and focus groups. While such data may be converted into a numerical value, it can be more difficult to analyse. Example: Survey comments, focus groups minutes, questionnaire responsesQuantitative Data This refers to data that is in numerical form that may be collected through surveys, models, experiments, or measurements. Such data are objective and suitable for statistical analysis, and consequently easier to compare. Example: Age of participants, data collected from businesses, experiment findings, admin data Table 7: Types of monitoring data Data Type Uses People accessing aservice Assessing whether an intervention is reaching its target population Process data Assessing whether intervention was implemented as intended Input dataAssessing whether inputs required met expectations and confirming assumptions of requirements were correct Output data Assessing whether the programme has delivered target outputs Outcome data Measuring benefits of delivering outputsSelect relevant dataItisalso important tonote that thepublic policy intervention should bemonitored both during and after implementation .Collecting data during implementation allows policy makers tocapture theinitial effects ofthe intervention, andmeasure how theintervention performs over itslifecycle .This cancapture theamount oftime it takes foranintervention to‘scale up’,and initial take-upand compliance rates .Continuing tomonitor an intervention after itsimplementation iskeytounderstanding how well theintervention works inthelong term, including whether theinitial effects oftheimplementation become more subdued over thepolicy ’slifecycle and whether there areanylong term behavioural responses totheintervention . Thetype andquantity ofdata thatneeds tobecollected willdepend onthetype ofintervention, andisbased on theindicators defined intheDesign and Appraise stage ofthePublic Policy Cycle .There aretwo main categories ofdata thatcanbecollected tohelp support apolicy evaluation : The quality ofthedata thatisrecorded hasadirect effect onthequality ofanintervention ’sevaluation, and consequently theconclusions that can bedrawn regarding thepolicy ’seffectiveness. Itistherefore very important togather complete, relevant and accurate data.Itisalso important toreference Chapter 5,where further information isprovided onMonitoring andEvaluation plans .Data canbecollected using anumber of different methods and tools .Insome cases, standard monitoring data canfulfill thedata needs forapolicy evaluation .This isgenerally quantitative andused totrack theimplementation ofapublic policy intervention . Table 7below sets outsome oftheways standard monitoring data canbecollected. 79 Insome cases, standard monitoring data canfulfill thedata needs forapolicy evaluation .However, incases where regular monitoring information isinsufficient, bespoke surveys orquestionnaires should beused to acquire thenecessary data andintelligence .When designing surveys, itisimportant toconsider thefollowing points : •Clearly clarify thegoal orobjective from thesurvey, thetarget group thatwillbeaddressed, andthesurvey method most appropriate forthetarget group ; •Determine thetype ofdata thatisrequired forcollection .There arefivemain data types asshown inTable 8; Table 8: Types of survey data Data Type Information collected Factual Factual information about respondents, such asage KnowledgeWhat knowledge participants have about aparticular topic and their awareness ofthepublic policy intervention Attitudinal Opinions, beliefs, values, andfeelings ofrespondents BehaviouralWhat people doorintend todoandhow ithaschanged after theintervention Preferential Preferences fordifferent options andoutcomes Table X: Forms of data collection Method Definition Random samplingRandomized selection of individuals (via computer -generation) where each respondent has equal chance of being selected. Stratified samplingDividing a population into groups and then selecting a probability sample from each group Cluster samplingSelecting clusters via a probability method and individuals within clusters are selected Multi -stage sampling Combination of sampling methodsTable 9: Sampling techniquesSurveys and questionnaires encompass awide range ofdata collection strategies .Generally, survey data involves collecting intelligence from apopulation and making inferences based ontheresults ofthesample group .Itisimportant thatanysurvey conducted hasarepresentative sample sizefrom which robust conclusions canbedrawn .Table 9below provides some examples ofdifferent ways tocollect data from surveys . 80 There aremany ways togather qualitative data when evaluating apublic policy intervention, andthisinformation can add context and nuance tothequantitative data produced .Table 10below sets outseveral different approaches thatpolicy makers canusewhen searching forqualitative data: Table 10: Forms of data collection Table 11: Question types Data Type Information collected StructuredClosed -ended questions thatoffer respondents alistorsetofoptions toselect from.Such questions may beused tofilter responses, rank questions, andobtain simple counts . Non-structuredOpen -ended questions that provide responders freedom towrite their own answers .Such questions may follow closed -ended questions togather insights onatopic . Partially structuredAmixofopen -andclosed -ended questions inorder togetspecific responses while also providing respondents withtheopportunity to explain their point ofview.Collection Method Description In-depth interviewsOpen -ended questions for detailed responses typically used when collecting data on personal experiences Focus groupsCollection of participants who debate openly and discuss views and experiences Case studies Investigations of a single issue Observation Watching research subjects to observe behaviour Ethnography Observation and review of participants Social media Collection and analysing online dataCollect relevant data When conducting interviews orother forms ofqualitative data collection, itisimportant tostructure questions ina waywhich suits theneeds ofthetarget audience andthatalso solicits theappropriate insights fortheevaluation . Questions should therefore bedeveloped carefully andtested before they areused withtheintended recipients . Table 11highlights some ofthemain types ofquestions which canbeused byinterviewers : 81 Once thedifferent information, data andintelligence thatisneeded toundertake arobust policy evaluation has been identified, thenext step istoidentify and assess thedifferent stakeholders that anentity willneed to interact withinorder togather thisinformation andinsight . Identify relevant stakeholders 03 Stakeholders have akeyroletoplay inthemonitoring andevaluation ofapublic policy intervention, ranging from thecollection ofdata tousing theevaluation todevelop future policies .When developing amonitoring plan, itis important toidentify inadvance theroles each stakeholder willplay intheoverall evaluation that isbeing undertaken, their objectives inthepolicy process andtheir skills andcapacity .Table 12sets outexamples of types ofstakeholders who areinvolved inthemonitoring andevaluation process . 82Table 12: Types of stakeholders Type of StakeholderDescription Internal / ExternalSkills and capacity Policy intervention developerThe requesting entity responsible for development of interventionInternal Evaluate and revise intervention as needed Data collection stakeholderMembers of a requesting entity or implementation team who are responsible for recording and tracking data during a policy ’s implementationInternal Ability to do basic statistical analysis Available mechanism to record live data Ability to communicate data results on a regular basis Government accountability stakeholdersThose within the government who seek to understand whether the intervention was effective, and whether the requirements were necessaryInternal Assesses the evaluation to ensure proper use of time and resources Ability to provide feedback on potential changes Recipients of the policyMembers of the public who experience the direct effects of the public policy interventionExternal Ability to provide data on a regular basis General public Members of the public who are interested in how government policies are being enactedExternal Provides scrutiny and allows the public to challenge, examine, and suggest reform Future policymakersThose who will utilize lessons learned from previous policy interventions to inform future changesBoth Informs future policy via lessons from previous interventions .2 Evaluate the policy Examine the existing evidence base 01 Having athorough understanding ofthepublic policy intervention isessential toanyevaluation .Asthefirstpart ofevaluation scoping, policy makers should outline how theintervention was expected towork inpractice, the assumptions underlying theintervention's design, and thewider context inwhich itoperated .This involves examining theevidence base behind thepolicy intervention, andidentifying where gaps orweaknesses inthe evidence base exist.Inidentifying gaps intheevidence base, policy makers canbetter understand thequestions theevaluation needs toanswer . Set out the purpose of the evaluation 02 Asuccessful evaluation willhave clearly set-outthequestions thatitintends toanswer, andhow those answers willbeused forfuture policy development .This includes setting outwho willbeusing theevaluation findings, andwhen .There areseveral different ways inwhich anevaluation canbeused, including : •Communicating anintervention ’simpact tothepublic •Risk identification •Measuring progress towards intended benefits •Informing future decision making (forexample, regulatory changes, larger rollouts) •Stakeholder engagement Itisalso important toreview theobjectives andgoals thatwere setoutduring thedesign stage ofthepublic policy intervention, asthese should play amajor partinhelping toscope theevaluation . Choose the type of evaluation that is required 03 There arethree broad types ofevaluations :process, impact andvalue -for-money .Each type ofevaluation is designed toproduce different information andresults, andeach should beused atdifferent points during the lifetime ofanindividual policy intervention .Table 13provides adescription ofeach type ofevaluation .When undertaking anevaluation ofapublic policy intervention, itisimportant tohave aclear understanding of thepurpose oftheevaluation and what isrequired toachieve thepredefined goals oroutputs .Evaluation scoping istheprocess foridentifying themain purpose ofthereview and what isneeded toconduct the evaluation successfully .Thegoals ofevaluation scoping areto: 1. Examine theexisting evidence base 2. Setoutthepurpose oftheevaluation 3. Choose thetype ofevaluation thatisrequired The goals ofanevaluation willvary depending onthespecific policy inquestion, andtheoverall aims ofthe exercise .These steps arediscussed inmore detail below : Undertake the evaluation 04There aremany factors toconsider when choosing themost appropriate type ofevaluation .Themost important ofthese factors istiming, asthelength oftime thatapolicy hasbeen implemented islikely todictate which sort ofevaluation ismost appropriate .Inmost instances, a‘process evaluation ’should beundertaken quite soon after theintervention hasbeen implemented, while an‘impact ’or‘value -for-money ’assessment would take place once thepolicy hasbeen inplace forseveral years . The choice ofevaluation type should also consider theuncertainties and assumptions intheintervention ’s evidence base, andtheneeds ofstakeholders, who would have been involved intheselection ofmethods to manage expectations and agree onobjectives .This willhelp manage expectations and ensure thefinal evaluation meets theneeds ofthose stakeholders . The selection ofthetype ofevaluation should also consider thetime andresources available toconduct the evaluation .Evaluation types range intheir time andresource intensity, andpolicy makers should berealistic about thecapacity toconduct anevaluation .Evaluation type Goal ofevaluation Questions answered Process evaluationWhat can be learned from how the evaluation was delivered?Was it delivered as planned? Did it function as planned? Did the context influence how it was delivered? How could its delivery be improved in the future? Impact evaluationWhat difference did the intervention make?Did it achieve expected outcomes? Was the intervention decisive in the change in outcomes? Can the intervention be replicated? Value -for- money evaluationWas the intervention a good use of public resources?Was the intervention cost effective? What were the costs and benefits? How would the intervention compare to alternatives? When running anevaluation, itisimportant toconsider thatthere areseveral different methodologies thatcould bedeployed .Different methodologies canbeused tosuitprocess, impact andvalue formoney evaluations, with varying amounts oftime andresource requirements .Forexample, process andimpact evaluations should make useofinterviews, focus groups, surveys, performance monitoring, andobservational studies .Each have their own benefits andlimitations (Table 14). 84Table 13: Types of evaluation Disseminate the results 05Impact evaluations, which look forcausal relationships from anintervention, often make useofexperimental or quasi -experimental studies .These types ofevaluation usemethods such asrandomized control trials (RCTs), difference -in-difference analysis, orregression discontinuity design .These methods areacademically rigorous and, when designed properly, canprovide arobust evidence base toassess theefficacy ofanintervention . However, they require asignificant amount oftime and resource tocomplete, typically with subject matter experts doing highly skilled research .Often, itmay notbepossible orethical toseparate participants into experimental and control groups, and thedata may notbeavailable toconduct thestudy inaway which produces verifiable andnon-biased results . Thedissemination andreporting oftheresults ofanevaluation torelevant stakeholders isakeystep toensure thecontinuous improvement ofpublic policy making, and toallow forearly responses toany issues or unintended results that have been identified .Itisimportant tobuild apublic sector evaluation culture that encourages reflection, collaboration, revision andtransparency .Table 14: Evaluation methodologies 85Method of evaluation Benefits Drawbacks Interviews / focus groups Allows for context Time intensive; not quantitative Case studies In depth Difficult to make findings generalizable Surveys Useful for statistical analysisLess in depth; response rate issues can limit generalizability Output monitoring Low cost; fast Can be inconvenient for participants and staff Observational studies Allows for understanding of individual experience‘Hawthorne effect ’ can mean participants act differently as they are conscious that they are being observed The structure, frequency, andlevel ofdetail thatisreported willdepend ontheaudience andthenature ofthe policy .Forinstance, reports prepared fortheimplementation team may require more details compared toreports prepared forsenior officials, ororganisational leadership . Itistherefore important tounderstand thedifference between direct andindirect stakeholders, astheir usage of theresults willvary considerably .Forthepurposes ofanevaluation, direct stakeholders aretypically those who aredeveloping, implementing orinspecting apublic policy intervention andmake useofevaluations toimprove design and implementation orevaluate effectiveness ofoutcomes .Indirect stakeholders arethose who have been involved ineither theconsultation ormonitoring process during thedevelopment oftheintervention .Define the audience 86Present the results Asdiscussed earlier inthischapter, there arevarious endusers ofevaluation reports andfindings, andthese different groups willmake useoftheresults indifferent ways .Asaresult, astandard written highlights report may notbethebest dissemination option inallcases. Itisimportant totailor results based ontheintended stakeholder, such asthrough theuseofone-pagers, infographics orsuccinct slide decks . There areseveral different ways toproduce ahigh quality summary report, andpolicy -makers should choose the best medium fortheintervention inquestion. Ataminimum, areport should include: The policy ’s desired objectives; Details on how the public policy intervention has worked in practice; Summary of the findings, performance of indicators against the predefined targets, and Conclusions based on the findings, which could include any of the following: •No changes to the policy are required, and it should continue as planned; •Some action is required to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved; •Policy must be revised due to adverse impact; or •Policy may need to be terminated. Iffurther information ordetail isrequired tounderstand thebest ways tosummarize evaluation results, policy officials should engage withindividual stakeholders andascertain their preferences orspecific needs . Evaluation During theMonitor andEvaluate stage, there isanopportunity toengage with theAbu Dhabi Executive Office toobtain direction andguidance onmonitoring and evaluation practices andtechniques .Evaluation ✓ Stakeholder Engagement ChecklistMonitor and Evaluate Stage Checklist Gather the required data to inform the identified performance indicators Conduct an evaluation on the policy ’s implementation and impact Review the policy ’s ability to achieve the desired objectives based on the evaluation results Present results to the respective stakeholders Inform relevant stakeholders of the metrics needed to conduct the policy evaluation Identify the relevant stakeholders needed to provide feedback of the policy ’s design and implementation Consult with relevant department(s) on the monitoring methods that should be deployed Consider setting up follow -up interview sessions with key stakeholders to understand the experience of delivering the policy on -the-ground Communicate the impact of the policy to the relevant departments and stakeholders, and consult them for feedback and potential improvements n All Rights Reserved for Abu Dhabi Executive Office © 2021 United Arab Emirates The Emirate Of Abu Dhabi Issued By The Gereral Secretariat of The Executive Council of The Emirate Of Abu Dhabi Office of Legal Affairs Abu Dhabi - P.O.

infigure 1supports innavigating between thesupplementary figures and information provided within thismanual : 5 section 1: overview 6 chapter 1: what is public policy? 7  the concept of ‘policy ’iscomplex, hasseveral dimensions and canlend itself todifferent interpretations .in general, apolicy isastatement thatsets outagovernment ’sintention, guiding principles, andthepractical action thatisundertaken torealise asetofdesired objectives. however, thisbroad definition needs toberefined to reflect how public policy ispracticed intheemirate ofabu dhabi .this chapter explores thedifferent types of policies and requests thatareproduced across thegovernment and provides guidance and advice onwhich should beconsidered within thescope ofthismanual andthewider public policy framework .chapter 1: what is public policy? 8policies can broadly bebroken down into three main types :‘public policies ’,‘operational policies ’and ‘organisational policies ’.the core distinction between thethree types isdefined bytheir domain (public or private) andtheimpact they have onstakeholders : •public policies arethegovernment ’schosen course ofaction, orinaction, onanissue ofpublic concern .they generate economic, social andenvironmental impacts andinvolve multiple stakeholders, including government departments, businesses, households and civil society .public policies canbeexpressed indifferent forms : visions, overarching public policies, strategies andspecific public policy interventions (figure 2). •operational policies areacourse ormethod ofaction selected byanentity todeal with operational matters when engaging with itsstakeholders .examples include facility licensing policies orissuing birth certification policies ;and, •organisational policies areacourse ormethod ofaction selected byanentity toguide anddetermine how internal human resource and financial management issues willbedealt with.they dictate rules within the entity ’sadministrative procedures .anexample ofthisisbusiness continuity policies .types of policies the government policy pyramid government policy beexpressed indifferent forms : •visions reflect thedesired future state andincludes specific priorities andideas ; •overarching public policies arederived from thegovernment ’svision and outline thehigh-level public policy positions onspecific issues ; •strategies arelong-term plans forrealising thegovernment ’svision andoverarching public policy positions; and, •public policy interventions aretargeted actions taken bythegovernment toachieve specific policy objectives .thescope ofthismanual isthedevelopment ofthislayer ofgovernment policy . when scoping and designing public policy interventions, and producing therequired business case, itis important forrequesting entities andpolicymakers tobeaware oftheinteractions between public policy and wider government and departmental strategy .assetoutearlier inthechapter, thebusiness case that requesting entities arerequired toproduce isdesigned specifically forpublic policy interventions, butin producing these cases entities willneed toconsider anddiscuss thelinkbetween theintervention andwider government strategy . figure 2: public policy pyramid the example below explains therelationship between thedifferent expressions ofpublic policy using general healthcare asanexample : tofulfil its vision doh designed several overarching public policies that address themain components ofthe abu dhabi healthcare system such asthe ‘doh policy on digital health ’.overarching public policiesvision

provision.public policy interventionstorealize the above overarching public policy doh designed an ‘e-health strategy ’.this would involve setting aplan onhow toprioritize theambitions ofthedoh policy ondigital health asthe public policy pyramid indicates, public policy interventions can bederived from either the government ’soverall vision, itsoverarching public policies, oritslonger -term strategies .itisimportant thatthe proposed interventions arealigned with theoverall strategic direction oftheentity inquestion, aswellasthe priorities ofboth theemirate ofabudhabi andtheuae.inanideal scenario, each level ofgovernment action would flow from thevision and/or overarching public policies (figure 2),andthisshould bediscussed inthebusiness case .inpractice, thiswillnotalways bethe case

theidentified issues .once this hasbeen determined, high -level objectives and keyperformance indicators should beidentified tosupport thepolicy analysis that takes place in thenext stage . indeveloping public policy interventions, governments respond toboth opportunities and problems .the agenda setting stage ofthepublic policy cycle isbased onaproblem -oriented approach topolicy

techniques thatcanprovide crucial insights through primary data, existing bodies ofresearch, andexperiences inother countries . establishing aclear definition ofthechallenge intheearly stages ofthepublic policy cycle isnecessary tohelp identify appropriate solutions .this process islikely tobeiterative and require different levels ofstakeholder engagement .environmental scanning, which involves identifying and tracking trends intheorganisation ’s internal andexternal environment, covers abroad range ofuseful techniques foridentifying challenges, whether they aredriven byproblems, challenges oropportunities. horizon scanning (figure 10)isauseful technique foridentifying and monitoring potentially important developments through thesystematic examination ofpotential threats and opportunities tothepolicy area in question .the approach isdriven bytheanalysis ofchanges, constants and uncertainties over defined time periods .itrequires consideration ofboth existing andemerging phenomena, butalso how different issues may interact toinfluence future outcomes .what is the nature of the challenge that needs to be addressed? 2401literature reviews :reviewing academic papers, white papers orother theoretically -backed views that study andanalyse thechallenge inquestion ; benchmarking :examining themanifestation oftheproblem inother countries, theevolution ofthe challenge andreviewing thelessons learned from elsewhere; and, primary data collection :gathering primary data from first-hand sources, such assurveys, interviews, focus groups orexperiments togenerate situation -specific insights .some core tools andtechniques thatcanbeapplied intheearly stages ofthepublic policy cycle todevelop a deep understanding ofthepolicy challenge are: figure 10: horizon scanning this three horizon model indicates how strategic andpolicy issues evolve over time: •horizon 1captures immediate strategic andpolicy priorities which arereadily apparent andmay bewellunderstood .ifnotalready, these issues should beonthepolicy agenda. •horizon 2shows thatissues may evolve, ornew issues may arise, inthemedium term.these issues, although less well understood, may present opportunities totackling emerging issues through public policy interventions . •horizon 3includes long-term strategic andpolicy issues which aredifficult todetermine from thepresent

atthebeginning ofthischapter, this can beachieved by deploying literature reviews, benchmarking studies orprimary data collection inorder toanswer aseries of predefined research questions . itisimportant toaskwide-ranging andprobing questions intheearly stages oftheprocess .while specific questions willvary bypolicy area, theexample research questions could be: •who isaffected? •how arethey affected? •what contributes totheproblem? •when andwhere istheproblem most likely tooccur? inaddressing these questions, itisimportant tobeasspecific aspossible about thedifferent stakeholders who areimpacted bythedifferent aspects ofthepolicy challenge .the following table highlights thekeyinternal andexternal stakeholders toconsider when identifying theimpacted parties during intervention analysis. table 2: stakeholders thestakeholders listed intable 2aredeliberately defined atahigh-level, andinpractice willneed tobefurther broken down through segmentation and/or demographic analysis .aparticular policy issue islikely toimpact specific groups more than others, andidentifying thespecific agents impacted byapublic policy isakeypartof theearly analysis. atthisstage itisparticularly important toperform stakeholder mapping . additional research into thenature ofthechallenge should also consider thespecific context, history and potential evolution oftheidentified problem(s) .research questions tosupport thisadditional assessment could include: •what isthehistory ofthechallenge? •who putthischallenge ontheagenda? •what arethespecific interests atstake (including demographic, geographic andsectoral)? •who isinvolved inthedecision -making? through detailed research andanalysis ofthequestions thataresetoutthroughout thischapter, requesting entities willbeable toprovide proportionate, well-reasoned evidence ofthenature andtype ofproblem(s) or challenge(s) . businesses economic stakeholders engaged in commercial, industrial, or professional activities, who transform factors of production into goods and services. households economic stakeholders who supply factors of production (labour and capital) and are consumers of final goods and services. civil societyindividuals or groups who share a common interest and are not connected to the government. civil society organisations can mediate the relationships between public authorities and citizens. government entities engaged in public sector activities which pass laws, collect revenues and directly consume economic goods and services.description stakeholder thebreadth ofissues covered bypolicy -makers often means thatachallenge may beidentified before thefull- scale orsizeisunderstood .theprimary purpose ofthisstep istoestablish aquantitative understanding ofthe challenge .this willrequire aninitial estimation ofthesize and anunderstanding ofthedemographic, geographic orsectoral variation, aswell asabalance between targeted analysis ofspecific questions with exploratory analysis toreveal anyunknown characteristics ofthechallenge .what is the size of the challenge that needs to be addressed? this willrequire arange ofdata sources, including national statistics, departmental data, proprietary data sources andprimary data.thecollection ofprimary data canbeparticularly important atthisstage because itis likely tobethemost specific information about thearea inquestion, however itcanbemore time consuming to collect andanalyse . policy challenges willoften draw onarange ofaggregate estimates, including both monetary and non- monetary aggregates .monetary statistics include market oreconomic valuations, where asnon-monetary statistics include measures offrequency, prevalence andcount, andpercentages . tounderstand thepolicy challenge itmay benecessary todisaggregate overall estimates bydifferent characteristics .this caninclude demographic, geographic andsectoral analysis . aggregate statistics may hide important characteristics ofthechallenge .consequently, itisimportant tolook beyond aggregates tounderstand measures ofvariation .this includes central tendency (mean, median, and mode), dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), andposition (percentile, quartile andrank) . different types ofdata analysis canbeused depending onthesalience ofthepolicy area, availability ofdata, and urgency oftherequest .methods range from descriptive statistics and trend analysis, tomore complex economic orstatistical assessments .forexample, supply and demand analysis (figure 11)isparticularly useful forchallenges with implications formarket outcomes, participants orstructures, asitsupports the understanding ofthedynamics anddeterminants ofsupply anddemand .this technique canalso beadjusted toexamine both capacity andneeds, which provides anunconstrainted economic assessment ofthesupply or demand inagiven market . 2702 what data are available? what aggregate statistics are required to understand the size of the

orthecounterfactual .once thescale oftheproblem hasbeen assessed, itispossible tostart toanalyse theunderlying drivers ofthe challenge orproblem inquestion. alogic tree isatool used tobreak down aproblem statement orquestion into itsmore simple subcomponents, allowing foreasier identification ofpotential rootcauses .theapproach helps togroup thecauses anddrills down further intothedetails ofeach grouping until each issue issufficiently explicit . this means theissues must bemutually exclusive andcollectively exhaustive (mece) . •'mutually exclusive ’indicates thatthere isnooverlap between thesubcomponents •'collectively exhaustive ’means thatthelogic treecovers allpotential rootcauses this exercise willprove helpful when identifying solutions toaddress theproblem statement, as responses may tackle theactual problem statement ortheindividual issues defining thecauses. asimple example ofalogic treeisoutlined below :what are the underlying drivers behind this challenge? acomprehensive problem analysis does notonly reveal thenature, sizeandlikely evolution ofaproblem, but isalso anindication ofthelikely causal -effect relationships that may beunderlying it.there anumber of methodologies andtechniques thatcanbedeployed atthisstage, ranging from qualitative problem solving tools, such asaroot cause analysis, oradvanced econometric orstatistical techniques .logic tree analysis (figure 12)isoneofseveral methodologies thatcanbeapplied tounderstand thedrivers behind aproblem . figure 12: logic tree analysis issue 1 sub-issue 1.1 sub-issue 1.2issue 2

towarrant agovernment response .before government intervention canbejustified, itisimportant toshowcase why government action isthebest way of dealing with theidentified problem and what would happen ifnoaction istaken .there isnosingle approach tojustifying government intervention, anditisimportant toconsider arange ofperspectives, including what would happen ifnointervention were totake place . 31013.2 establish the rationale for government intervention legalistic analysis oftheneed forgovernment intervention isoneapproach, andincludes addressing questions such as: •isthere alegal basis forgovernment intervention? •isgovernment intervention proportional tothesizeoftheproblem? •isthepolicy area under theexclusive competence ofthegovernment ordepartment? itisalso possible tojustify government intervention onthebasis ofeconomic grounds, including to address regulatory failure, market failure, ortopromote social orpublic goals .forexample, theuseof logic trees may indicate thattheroot cause oftheissue isdriven byinappropriate regulatory design, leading toeconomic distortions andinefficient economic outcomes .three examples ofpossible triggers forgovernment intervention areprovided infigure 14. market failure market failure usually arises when thecurrent market system failstoefficiently allocate goods orservices .forexample :regulatory failure this can occur when regulations are not well - designed to address an issue and they result in unintended consequences. this can lead to costs for businesses and/or society. social goals government intervention may be required in order to address distributional or equality objectives, or advance specific priorities for the public good. figure 14: triggers for government intervention 320301 02public goods :these are non-excludable (can be consumed byallwithout restriction) and non-rivalrous (can beconsumed byanynumber ofindividuals with no impact onbenefits) .they aretypically notprovided by markets (for example defense services) without government intervention . imperfect information :information isneeded for markets tooperate efficiently .regulation may be needed toenforce information disclosure, forexample : providing terms andconditions when rendering services orproviding price transparency onreceipts . externalities :these arethesocial costs and benefits thatarise from economic activities which areincurred by athird party who has nocontrol over thedecision to create that cost orbenefit .forexample, thecost of pollution isfeltbythepublic rather than theindustry responsible forcreating it. market power :this occurs when there isinsufficient competition inthemarket, due toeither thenumber of firms ormarket share offirms, resulting ininefficient prices, inadequate competition and consumer choice, bundling goods orservices, and dead weight loss.for example, amarket which isdominated byonefirmmay result inunjustifiably high consumer prices. the various techniques highlighted throughout thischapter aredesigned tohelp requesting entities identify problems across allpolicy areas, assess them effectively, and toidentify whether government intervention is required .the final partofthischapter addresses how toseteffective objectives andperformance indicators in order totackle theproblems thathave been identified above . term definition example outputsthe products, services

toconsider how theobjectives might impact thestrategy ofother government departments, particularly where thepolicy area islikely torequire collaboration withthedepartments inquestion . the absence ofclearly defined objectives may lead toimproper policy selection, ineffective appraisals, and subsequently ineffective policies .thesmart framework (figure 16)provides guidance oncharacteristics that contribute towell-defined objectives .engage stakeholders on objectives figure 15: engaging stakeholders on objectives the following questions may beuseful tohelp develop anunderstanding ofthespecific

same objective may result in different magnitudes of impact depending on the behavioural change they generate. for example, depending on the specific case, fiscal instruments may be expected to generate larger changes in behaviour than information provision resulting in larger overall impacts. scope of interventionthe scope of a potential intervention identifies stakeholders who will be targeted, and the geographical location in which the proposed intervention will apply. typically, a policy that targets a larger stakeholder group or geographical location would be expected to generate a larger impact. duration of interventionin some cases, the direct effect of an intervention on the criteria may be positive, whilst the indirect effects are negative. for example, an intervention may increase employment in one sector but decrease it in another. in this case, the overall effect should be used to determine the direction of impact. likelihood of impact occurringsome impacts are more certain to occur than others. mca provides aconsistent and standardised means ofcomparing options. the final scores calculated can therefore becompared tohelp select thepreferred

it is important to remember that impacts should always be measured in relation to the counterfactual. this is the scenario which would have occurred if the intervention had not been put in place, and the world had continued with business as usual (bau). impact should always be compared to the counterfactual to avoid overstating or understating the potential impact.*this step is only required if further evidence is requested after pre -approval* *this step is only required if further evidence is requested after pre -approval* there areanumber ofother considerations which should also betaken into account when conducting quantitative analysis .these aresetoutinmore detail figures 30and31. figure 30: making and logging assumptions quantitative analysis usually involves making several assumptions. these may include: these should be clearly documented in an assumptions tracker, with ratings or commentary to indicate how likely the assumptions are to be true, and how large an impact they will have on the results. an example assumptions tracker is provided below: # descriptionhow likely is the assumption to be true?how significant is the assumption to the overall result? 1price

:public policy interventions generally require participation from several different stakeholders, anditisimportant toalign with these organisations early intheprocess toensure thesuccessful implementation ofanyintervention. this includes internal communications within theentity, andexternal communications with other organisations, theprivate sector and, where necessary, citizens andconsumers .allstakeholder maps should also bereviewed alongside thefinal implementation plan, andanynew stakeholders should bemade aware oftheir roleandhow thepolicy may affect them ; •raise public awareness :one ofthebiggest risks thatcould cause issues during implementation isthe absence ofacommon understanding amongst thegeneral public ontheupcoming changes .assuch, developing aninformation and/or marketing plan toraise awareness within therelevant communities in advance ofthelaunch ofthepolicy isvital; •establish policy governance :some policies may require theformation ofcommittees, while others may require theformation ofateam, sector, ordepartment .regardless ofwhat therequirement is,forming the governance required forimplementation must becovered before thepublic policy intervention islaunched ; and •deliver and confirm implementation requirements :allrequirements identified forthepre-launch stage willbecompleted toensure effective implementation .this includes theallocation ofbudget andfinance andtheprovision ofadditional resources andskills .this may also involve tasks likeobtaining proposals from vendors orsuppliers . 5.2 launch and execute the policy the approved option should bedelivered inaccordance with theimplementation plan, themonitoring and evaluation plan, andanyriskmitigation plans thathave been created .these plans areallcovered inmore detail inearlier parts ofthismanual . 72the risks identified during thedesign and appraise stage willneed tobemanaged once apublic policy intervention isimplemented, and risk registers and risk cards should bemade available toallkey stakeholders responsible forimplementation. theimplementation plan should have considered how best to mitigate these risks, andatthisstage those who aretasked withdelivery should have robust plans inplace . once thepublic policy intervention islaunched, itsdelivery should beclearly announced and actively monitored .this enables improved functioning and data tracking oftheintervention, which iscritical to conducting arobust, detailed evaluation attheappropriate time.there areseveral ways thatthiscanbe done, andfurther information isprovided inchapter

and, attheright time, evaluate itsoverall impact .asthefourth and final step inthepublic policy cycle, itisintended toprovide policy -makers with objective analysis andinsights toinform future decision -making . within thepublic policy cycle, monitoring and evaluation have distinct butinterrelated roles (figure 37). broadly speaking, monitoring isacontinuous process, while fullevaluations take place atkeymilestones. figure 36: monitor and evaluate stage overview stage of the public policy cycle adeo interaction (* = indicates mandatory step) 1 agenda setting 3 implement 4 monitor and evaluate2 design and appraise evaluationhow do we ensure this is still the best way? evaluate the policy 4.2monitor policy implementation 4.1 figure 37: monitor and evaluate goals monitor: this involves the frequent collection of data related to the intervention and can be used to assess progress. monitoring sets the foundation on which an evaluation can take place, as proper evaluation is reliant on adequate data and information. evaluate: adetailed public policy assessment uses theavailable information toexamine apolicy ’sdesign, functionality andability to meet itsobjectives andoutputs .together, monitoring and evaluation activities assess the key aspects of any policy intervention, and are ultimately used to determine how successful the policy intervention has been, and what improvements can be made. the remainder ofthischapter willprovide advice, guidance andanoverview ofdifferent tools andtechniques thatcanbeused tosupport policy -makers intheir monitoring andevaluation activity .thechapter issplitintotwo core parts : 1. monitor policy implementation 2. evaluate thepolicy before designing amonitoring andevaluation strategy, itisimportant toconsider itspurpose andimportance for thewider public policy cycle .this helps toprovide aframework onwhich toplan thespecific monitoring and evaluation activities that need totake place and ensures thatthey areadapted tothespecifics ofthepolicy intervention being assessed . why is public policy evaluation important? 01 evaluating public policy interventions isavital partofthedevelopment process because itallows policy -makers andthewider public tounderstand theimpacts ofchanges andallows thelessons learned tobeentered intothe evidence base used todevelop future policies .astrong public policy evaluation programme results intwokey outcomes :improved learning andincreased accountability . learning :through monitoring and evaluation, policy makers can gauge whether theimplemented intervention isproducing theimpacts that itwas forecast to.intheearly stages ofapolicy ’s implementation, learning canhelp adapt thepolicy ’sdesign toimprove itsfunctionality andperformance . insome cases, pilots ofapublic policy intervention areheld totestthepolicy ’sdesign inacontrolled setting, andthelearnings from thepilot caninform itsdevelopment forlarger scale interventions .itis important totake learnings from both successful andunsuccessful interventions, asboth provide insights which canbeuseful forfuture interventions . accountability :evaluating public policy helps tohold thegovernment andpublic sector toaccount for thechanges thatthey have made .this includes ensuring thatgovernment money isspent inaprudent and transparent manner, and that policies deliver theresults that they have were designed to.by evaluating theresults ofanintervention, thegovernment candemonstrate thatitisacting inthepublic interest and informing thepublic oftheresults itisachieving .this helps tobuild trust between government andthepublic andcanhelp improve compliance ifthepublic iswellinformed ofthepurpose andresults ofaparticular initiative. what is a successful public policy evaluation? 02 asuccessful public policy evaluation results inaholistic assessment ofanintervention ’seffects, andoutlines what canbelearned from itsdesign andimplementation .inorder todevelop thisassessment, anintervention should bemonitored throughout itsimplementation, from early stages tothepoint theevaluation takes place . effective monitoring and evaluation should provide insights across several stages oftheintervention ’slogic model (figure 38). figure 38: impact evaluation effective monitoring and evaluation should assess different dimensions oftheintervention .there aremany different potential dimensions, and policy -makers should select those that aremost relevant totheir specific policy, butallevaluations intheemirate ofabudhabi should include atleast thefollowing : 77outputs activitiesinputs inputs inputsoutcomes outcomes outcomes inputs : resources that feed into the policy ’s activities or processes, and are generally straightforward and easy to identify, such as financials, employees, equipment, systemsactivities: actions, activities, or processes undertaken as part of the policy ’s implementation. outputs: the products, services or capital goods that result from an intervention, such as number of families who attended an awareness programme, or number of households that have been visitedoutcomes: the expected effects of an intervention's outputs. typically, observable and measurable indicators to measure progress, and that have predefined targets to determine desired levels (for example: % reduction in smoking) relevance focuses onassessing theextent towhich theobjectives anddesign stillmeet theneeds and problems itsought toaddress .this requires reviewing theimportance oftheintervention byreassessing itsusefulness intackling theidentified problem atthetime oftheevaluation (future state) .astime goes by,theoverall circumstances may have changed andhence theinitially identified problems may also have changed ascompared towhen thepolicy was initially designed .analysing any misalignment between theneed atthetime oftheevaluation andthepolicy objectives would support inidentifying the relevance ofthepolicy being assessed ; effectiveness links thepublic policy intervention toitsdesired objectives byassessing thesuccess of theintervention inachieving orprogressing towards these goals .the objectives defined during the agenda setting stage canbeused askpis ; efficiency weighs thecosts being incurred bythepublic policy intervention andtheactual change ithas achieved .this canbeassessed using acost-benefit analysis ofthecosts thathave resulted from the public policy intervention andcomparing these tothechanges ithasactually ledto(changes canbe positive ornegative) ;and, impact, oradded value, assesses theactual impacts against those estimated during theappraisal stage ofthepolicy development cycle .exceeding theestimated positive impacts (benefits) isconsidered a success, while exceeding negative impacts (costs) would reveal that they were potentially underestimated during thepolicy development cycle . forexample, some keyquestions apublic policy evaluation cananswer are: ●how istheintervention operating inpractice compared tohow itwasdesigned tooperate? ●which groups aremost affected bytheintervention, andwhich groups areleast affected? ●isthepolicy delivering within budget? ●how aretheimpacts oftheintervention feltacross different stakeholders? ●what improvements can bemade tohelp the policy deliver better results ormitigate unintended consequences? every monitoring andevaluation strategy should consider both thestages anddimensions oftheintervention anditsintended impacts when framing thestrategy .allother parts ofthestrategy anddata requirements will flow from aclear understanding ofwhat success looks likefortheintervention ateach stage andacross each dimension . monitoring apublic policy intervention sets thefoundation onwhich evaluation can take place, asproper evaluation isreliant onadequate data and robust information .one oftheaims ofthemonitoring step isto examine what changes have occurred since theimplementation ofanintervention. itisgenerally recommended torecord thefollowing aspects : •implementation :how closely theimplementation plan (asdeveloped during thedesign andappraise stage) wasfollowed; •application :theextent towhich thepolicy met itsobjectives and theways inwhich theintervention has triggered change ; •compliance andenforcement :level ofcompliance bystakeholders involved ;and •contextual information :additional information that may notbedirectly related totheintervention but provides wider context (forexample :economic growth andnew technologies) . there areseveral important steps that need tobefollowed toensure that apublic policy intervention is monitored effectively, andtoensure thatthecorrect data areavailable fortheevaluation .these aresetoutin more detail below .6.1 monitor policy implementation develop a plan early 01 developing aplan tomonitor apublic policy intervention early intheintervention ’sdevelopment isessential toa successful evaluation .amonitoring plan should bealigned with theobjectives ofapublic policy intervention, so thatthedata thatiscollected isrelevant totheintervention ’sstated goals .further information onthese plans is available inchapter 5. set data requirements 02 itisessential togather baseline data before apolicy intervention isimplemented, sothat theeffects ofthe intervention canbemeasured against historic performance before theintervention took place .this allows policy makers tocompare data andperformance measures ofthenew policy intervention with past results, tomeasure theimpact theintervention hadcompared toaworld inwhich itdidnottake place . figure 39: general data types qualitative data this refers to data that is descriptive, and is collected through methods like interviews, observations and focus groups. while such data may be converted into a numerical value, it can be more difficult to analyse. example: survey comments, focus groups minutes, questionnaire responsesquantitative data this refers to data that is in numerical form that may be collected through surveys, models, experiments, or measurements. such data are objective and suitable for statistical analysis, and consequently easier to compare. example: age of participants, data collected from businesses, experiment findings, admin data table 7: types of monitoring data data type uses people accessing aservice assessing whether an intervention is reaching its target population process data assessing whether intervention was implemented as intended input dataassessing whether inputs required met expectations and confirming assumptions of requirements were correct output data assessing whether the programme has delivered target outputs outcome data measuring benefits of delivering outputsselect relevant dataitisalso important tonote that thepublic policy intervention should bemonitored both during and after implementation .collecting data during implementation allows policy makers tocapture theinitial effects ofthe intervention, andmeasure how theintervention performs over itslifecycle .this cancapture theamount oftime it takes foranintervention to‘scale up’,and initial take-upand compliance rates .continuing tomonitor an intervention after itsimplementation iskeytounderstanding how well theintervention works inthelong term, including whether theinitial effects oftheimplementation become more subdued over thepolicy ’slifecycle and whether there areanylong term behavioural responses totheintervention . thetype andquantity ofdata thatneeds tobecollected willdepend onthetype ofintervention, andisbased on theindicators defined inthedesign and appraise stage ofthepublic policy cycle .there aretwo main categories ofdata thatcanbecollected tohelp support apolicy evaluation : the quality ofthedata thatisrecorded hasadirect effect onthequality ofanintervention ’sevaluation, and consequently theconclusions that can bedrawn regarding thepolicy ’seffectiveness. itistherefore very important togather complete, relevant and accurate data.itisalso important toreference chapter 5,where further information isprovided onmonitoring andevaluation plans .data canbecollected using anumber of different methods and tools .insome cases, standard monitoring data canfulfill thedata needs forapolicy evaluation .this isgenerally quantitative andused totrack theimplementation ofapublic policy intervention . table 7below sets outsome oftheways standard monitoring data canbecollected. 79 insome cases, standard monitoring data canfulfill thedata needs forapolicy evaluation .however, incases where regular monitoring information isinsufficient, bespoke surveys orquestionnaires should beused to acquire thenecessary data andintelligence .when designing surveys, itisimportant toconsider thefollowing points : •clearly clarify thegoal orobjective from thesurvey, thetarget group thatwillbeaddressed, andthesurvey method most appropriate forthetarget group ; •determine thetype

istoidentify and assess thedifferent stakeholders that anentity willneed to interact withinorder togather thisinformation andinsight . identify relevant stakeholders 03 stakeholders have akeyroletoplay inthemonitoring andevaluation ofapublic policy intervention, ranging from thecollection ofdata tousing theevaluation todevelop future policies .when developing amonitoring plan, itis important toidentify inadvance theroles each stakeholder willplay intheoverall evaluation that isbeing undertaken, their objectives inthepolicy process andtheir skills andcapacity .table 12sets

interventions to inform future changesboth informs future policy via lessons from previous interventions .2 evaluate the policy examine the existing evidence base 01 having athorough understanding ofthepublic policy intervention isessential toanyevaluation .asthefirstpart ofevaluation scoping, policy makers should outline how theintervention was expected towork inpractice, the assumptions underlying theintervention's design, and thewider context inwhich itoperated .this involves examining theevidence base behind thepolicy intervention, andidentifying where gaps orweaknesses inthe evidence base exist.inidentifying gaps intheevidence base, policy makers canbetter understand thequestions theevaluation needs toanswer . set out the purpose of the evaluation 02 asuccessful evaluation willhave clearly set-outthequestions thatitintends toanswer, andhow those answers willbeused forfuture policy development .this includes setting outwho willbeusing theevaluation findings, andwhen .there areseveral different ways inwhich anevaluation canbeused, including : •communicating anintervention ’simpact tothepublic •risk identification •measuring progress towards intended benefits •informing future decision making (forexample, regulatory changes, larger rollouts) •stakeholder engagement itisalso important toreview theobjectives andgoals thatwere setoutduring thedesign stage ofthepublic policy intervention, asthese should play amajor partinhelping toscope theevaluation . choose the type of evaluation that is required 03 there arethree broad types ofevaluations :process, impact andvalue -for-money .each type ofevaluation is designed toproduce different information andresults, andeach should beused atdifferent points during the lifetime ofanindividual policy intervention .table 13provides adescription ofeach type ofevaluation .when undertaking anevaluation ofapublic policy intervention, itisimportant tohave aclear understanding of thepurpose oftheevaluation and what isrequired toachieve thepredefined goals oroutputs .evaluation scoping istheprocess foridentifying themain purpose ofthereview and what isneeded toconduct the evaluation successfully .thegoals ofevaluation scoping areto: 1. examine theexisting evidence base 2. setoutthepurpose oftheevaluation 3. choose thetype ofevaluation thatisrequired the goals ofanevaluation willvary depending onthespecific policy inquestion, andtheoverall aims ofthe exercise .these steps arediscussed inmore detail below : undertake the evaluation 04there aremany factors toconsider when choosing themost appropriate type ofevaluation .themost important ofthese factors istiming, asthelength oftime thatapolicy hasbeen implemented islikely todictate which sort ofevaluation ismost appropriate .inmost instances, a‘process evaluation ’should beundertaken quite soon after theintervention hasbeen implemented, while an‘impact ’or‘value -for-money ’assessment would take place once thepolicy hasbeen inplace forseveral years . the choice ofevaluation type should also consider theuncertainties and assumptions intheintervention ’s evidence base, andtheneeds ofstakeholders, who would have been involved intheselection ofmethods to manage expectations and agree onobjectives .this willhelp manage expectations and ensure thefinal evaluation meets theneeds ofthose stakeholders . the selection ofthetype ofevaluation should also consider thetime andresources available toconduct the evaluation .evaluation types range intheir time andresource intensity, andpolicy makers should berealistic about thecapacity toconduct anevaluation .evaluation type goal ofevaluation questions answered process evaluationwhat can be learned from how the evaluation was delivered?was it delivered as planned? did it function as planned? did the context influence how it was delivered? how could its delivery be improved in the future? impact evaluationwhat difference did the intervention make?did it achieve expected outcomes? was the intervention decisive in the change in outcomes? can the intervention be replicated? value -for- money evaluationwas the intervention a good use of public resources?was the intervention cost effective? what were the costs and benefits? how would the intervention compare to alternatives? when running anevaluation, itisimportant toconsider thatthere areseveral different methodologies thatcould bedeployed .different methodologies canbeused tosuitprocess, impact andvalue formoney evaluations, with varying amounts oftime andresource requirements .forexample, process andimpact evaluations should make useofinterviews, focus groups, surveys, performance monitoring, andobservational studies .each have their own benefits andlimitations (table 14). 84table 13: types of evaluation disseminate the results 05impact evaluations, which look forcausal relationships from anintervention, often make useofexperimental or quasi -experimental studies .these types ofevaluation usemethods such asrandomized control trials (rcts), difference -in-difference analysis, orregression discontinuity design .these methods areacademically rigorous and, when designed properly, canprovide arobust evidence base toassess theefficacy ofanintervention . however, they require asignificant amount oftime and resource tocomplete, typically with subject matter experts doing highly skilled research .often, itmay notbepossible orethical toseparate participants into experimental and control groups, and thedata may notbeavailable toconduct thestudy inaway which produces verifiable andnon-biased results . thedissemination andreporting oftheresults ofanevaluation torelevant stakeholders isakeystep toensure thecontinuous improvement ofpublic policy making, and toallow forearly responses toany issues or unintended results that have been identified .itisimportant tobuild apublic sector evaluation culture that encourages reflection, collaboration, revision andtransparency .table 14: evaluation methodologies 85method of evaluation benefits drawbacks interviews / focus groups allows for context time intensive; not quantitative case studies in depth difficult to make findings generalizable surveys useful for statistical analysisless in depth; response rate issues can limit generalizability output monitoring low cost; fast can be inconvenient for participants and staff observational studies allows for understanding of individual experience‘hawthorne effect ’ can mean participants act differently as they are conscious that they are being observed the structure, frequency, andlevel ofdetail thatisreported willdepend ontheaudience andthenature ofthe policy .forinstance, reports prepared fortheimplementation team may require more details compared toreports prepared forsenior officials, ororganisational leadership . itistherefore important tounderstand thedifference between direct andindirect stakeholders, astheir usage of theresults willvary considerably .forthepurposes ofanevaluation, direct stakeholders aretypically those who aredeveloping, implementing orinspecting apublic policy intervention andmake useofevaluations toimprove design and implementation orevaluate effectiveness ofoutcomes .indirect stakeholders arethose who have been involved ineither theconsultation ormonitoring process during thedevelopment oftheintervention .define the audience 86present the results asdiscussed earlier inthischapter, there arevarious endusers ofevaluation reports andfindings, andthese different groups willmake useoftheresults indifferent ways .asaresult, astandard written highlights report may notbethebest dissemination option inallcases. itisimportant totailor results based ontheintended stakeholder, such asthrough theuseofone-pagers, infographics orsuccinct slide decks . there areseveral different ways toproduce ahigh quality summary report, andpolicy -makers should choose the best medium fortheintervention inquestion. ataminimum, areport should include: the policy ’s desired objectives; details on how the public policy intervention has worked in practice; summary of the findings, performance of indicators against the predefined targets, and conclusions based on the findings, which could include any of the following: •no changes to the policy are required, and it should continue as planned; •some action is required to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved; •policy must be revised due to adverse impact; or •policy may need to be terminated. iffurther

Issuance Date: 13 December 2022 Corresponding to: 19 Jumada Al Owla 1444 HijriSaif Saeed Ghobash Secretary-General \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003  \u0003 General Policy for the Management, Regulation and Protection of Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi. 2022. 1. Introduction This Policy reviews the existing state of groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the challenges and implications of its depletion. One of the major challenges facing groundwater is the depletion of the reservoir as that the extraction rates exceed the natural recharge \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 It also defines its underlying principles and the relevant legal framework. Groundwater is one of the main natural resources, and the ratio of the total use of freshwater (which includes both surface water and fossil groundwater) out of the total renewable water resources available is one of the indicators by which water scarcity is measured, taking into account that the results are equalised through a weight that is determined to reflect the use of desalinated water and treated wastewater. In this context, although the water scarcity index in the Emirate is one of the lowest in the world, the Emirate records one of the h ighest rates of per capita water consumption. Most groundwater resources are surface aquifers, which are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity. Most of the groundwater reservoirs in the Emirate are non - renewable. Groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water resources consumed in the Emirate and is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. The Policy is drawn up in implementation of the provisions of Law No. (5) of 2016 concerning the Regulation of Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\u0003rates. This depletion caused a decrease in groundwater levels and a deterioration of its quality in many areas, where 79% of it has become highly saline,18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water. The deterioration of groundwater quality affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector, which plays an important role in achieving food security and stimulating related economic activities. It also has economic consequences manifested in resorting to other water sources such as desalinated water and recycled water that requires investments for transportation and distribution . In addition, the increase of groundwater salinity leads to the need to maintain and replace irrigation networks, which increases costs for farmers. From the environmental point of view, the deterioration of the quality of groundwater and its lower level s causes the agricultural sector to depend on small desalination plants, which in turn cause various environmental impacts, such as high greenhouse gas emissions. In response to the foregoing, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi adopts, through this Policy, the necessary measures to ensure the integrated and effective use of the various water resources, through sustainable management, as well as through the regulation, management and monitoring of groundwater. \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 2. Scope of Application This Policy is implemented in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and is supervised by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi, through consultation, coordination and cooperation with the concerned entities, whether within the governmental or the private sector, \u0003well as through analysing the economic, s ocial, environmental, technical, health and organisational impacts, based on systematic and organised procedures that contribute to achieving the objectives sought. \u0003 3. Main Principles Underlying the Policy This Policy is based on several main principles related to groundwater issues: The Issue Main Principles  Groundwater alternatives Encourage consumers to use alternative water sources for groundwater such as recycled water; taking into account economic, environmental, technical, organisational, social and health considerations. Conservation and efficient use of groundwater Ensure that all cur rent and future users maintain and rationalise groundwater use as efficiently as possible, using Water Demand Management policies. Allocation of agricultural lands Allocat e lands for agricultural purposes only in non -restricted areas with long - term sustainable water resources. Economic value of groundwater Educat e consumers about the economic value of groundwater and the importance of preserving it and rationalising its use . Research and development Direct research and development as a base for future foreseeing and promoting innovative technical solutions in terms of optimal use and preservation of groundwater. Emergencies Groundwater is used in emergencies as an alternative source of water in such cases. \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 4. Legal Framework Article (3) of Law No. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi stipulates that the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi shall have the competence to: ‘Draw up the General Policy related to the management, regulation and protection of groundwater, in coordination with the entity concerned with energy in the Emirate, and submit it to the Executive Council for approval.’ 5. Analysis The existing state of groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi The existing state of groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi can be summarised as follows: • Groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water consumed in the Emirate (Groundwater Atlas of Abu Dhabi Emirate, 2018). • Groundwater is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. \u0003• Groundwater extraction rates in the Emirate are about 24 times the rates of natural recharge. • The state of the groundwater is constantly deteriorating as the levels of deterioration in some areas have led to their classification as restricted areas. • The increasing demand for groundwater requires joint or coordinated initiatives with various stakeholders and actors involved. \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 Groundwater resources in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi Surface aquifers are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity, and most groundwater reservoirs in the Emirate are non -renewable reservoirs. Because of the excessive pumping of water from these reservoirs, groundwater levels decreased and groundwater quality deteriorated in many areas, as 79% of it became highly saline water, 18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water, according to the classification of water quality depending on salinity, which was developed by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi. Pressures the food sufficiency rate, greening the desert, and expanding parks and gardens also contribu ted to an increase of demand for irrigation water, despite the existing effort among the concerned entities on the importance and necessity of preserving groundwater and the shift in policies and legislation to focus on groundwater preservation. The low ra te of water renewal, the lack of efficient irrigation techniques and the selection of crop quality contribute to increasing pressures, and cause excessive consumption of groundwater in the Emirate, as the demand for groundwater has reached unsustainable le vels, leading to its depletion and to the deterioration of its quality. The results of the Groundwater Well Inventory project in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi indicate that the use of groundwater in the Emirate reached 2,100 million cubic meters in \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 Irrigation of crops and irrigation of forests increases the demand for groundwater.

(Groun dwater Atlas of Abu Dhabi Emirate, 2018).\u0003 Water Stress Index in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates and a number of other countries International reports show that the United Arab Emirates ranked tenth in the world in the list of countries with the highest levels of Water Stress, which is an indicator that measures the withdrawal of fresh water a s a percentage of the fresh water resources available . According to the World Resources Institute, the level of Water Stress in the State reached 4.26, while the average for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi was slightly higher, as it reached 4.44 in 2019.    In comparison with countries in the region, the rate of water withdrawal in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is 24 times the rate of natural recharge, while the rate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is 6 times higher, and 2.5 times in the Sultanate of Oman (National Water Strategy 2030, Saudi Arabia, 2018 and the Report on the State of Groundwater in the Sultanate of Oman 2019).            * World  Resources Institute, 2019 (Aquaduct project) - Water Stress Index  \u0003Water Stress Index and comparison with a number of countries in the region and the world (Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of freshwater resources available) * - 2019 - Water Stress Level \u00034.44 is the rate for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi \u0003State\u0003 United States \u0003 Denmark\u0003 Germany\u0003 Egypt\u0003 UAE\u0003 Saudi Arabia\u0003 Kuwait\u0003global ranking \u0003 \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003   Economic and social effects The increase in the demand for groundwater results in a deterioration of its quality which affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector. Preserving groundwater contributes to sustainable agricultural development, and thus to an increase in gross domestic product. Agriculture plays a crucial role in achieving food security and stimulating other related economic activities. During the past decades, the number of agricultural holdings has increased 38 times, from 634 holdings in 1971 to 24,018 ho ldings in 2019, while the area of agricultural lands has increased 33 times \u0003 \u0003  from around 22 thousand dunams to around 750 thousand dunams during the same period. Agriculture currently contributes to less than 1% of the Emirate's GDP. The government provides an integrated support system for the agricultural sector, such as vital security programmes that include the Palm Pest Control Programme, the Invasive Insects and Pest Control Programme, and technical programmes such as agricultural extension and training of farm workers to raise their efficiency and enhance their expertise. In this context, the Abu Dhabi Authority for Agriculture and Food Safety provided during the first quarter of the year 2020 more than AED 271.4 million to farmers benefiting fro m the Programme to Improve Farmers’ Incomes \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 implemented by the Authority, and more than 13 thousand farmers have benefited from it since the year 2000. Agricultural support policies have witnessed a change from focusing on production quantities to maintaining the quality of farms and encouraging sel f- sufficiency for their owners. Due to the deterioration of groundwater quality, alternatives of desalinated water and treated wastewater that require capital and operational investments for transportation and distribution are currently being resorted to. The salinity of groundwater also affects the irrigation networks and the need to rehabilitate and replace them over short periods of time. Groundwater depletion affects the abundance of groundwater reserves, which are considered strategic reserves for f uture generations. This will have negative effects on agricultural products, thus affecting the income and returns of farmers and farm owners. It also leads to the need to provide alternatives of fresh water as a strategic reserve. In addition, the extrac tion and use of groundwater takes place without placing any direct cost on the users, as the Study on the Economic Assessment of \u0003 \u0003  \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 its quality and to lower agricultural production. Because of the lack of alternatives, reliance is placed on small desalination plants in farms, which Expected results of applying the Policy on the economic and social level s 1. 2. The use of alternative water will lead to the continuation of agricultural activities in areas where the quantity and quality of groundwater is deteriorating. 3. A shift will be made to higher economic value crops with efficient water consumption, which will lead to an expected gradual improvement in the value of agricultural products. 4. The development of programmes and services for the agricultural sector will lead to a better alignment with the needs of farmers in the context of water use efficiency. \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 Groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, conducted by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi, indicates that the estimated economic value of each cubic meter of groundwater ranges between AED 7.7 and AED 9, and the economic value is the estimated total groundwater in Abu Dhabi ranges between AED 15.5 and AED 18 billion annually.  Environmental effects The decrease of usable groundwater reserves leads to its depletion and to deterioration of its quality. This results in the accumulation of salinity in the surface agricultural soil, the deterioration of \u0003lead to negative environmental effects on the ecosystem in general, such as the discharge of waste water from desalination plants into unsealed ponds, which leads to groundwater and soil pollution, in addition to the high carbon dioxide emissions from the water desalination process, which exacerbates the phenomenon of climate change. Given the dependence of the forest sector on groundwater for irrigation, there are environmental impacts on biodiversity (plants and animals) as a result of the deterioration of the quality and quantity of groundwater used in this sector.  The methods of disposing of the return water resulting from the desalination of groundwater in farms and the use of pesticides and fertilisers also affect the quality of groundwater and soil. \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003Expected results of applying the Policy on the environmental level The Policy is expected to achieve positive environmental impacts as follows: 1. Decrease of groundwater extraction by 650 million cubic meters by 2030. 2. Improvement of the groundwater quality index (locally and federally). 3. Decrease of the rate of water extraction versus the rate of recharge from 24 to 16 times by 2030. 4. The use of recycled water will enhance the recharge of the aquifer in the areas that are used for irrigation (in terms of quality and quantity). \u0003 Classification: Confidential \u0003 ©SADER\u0003 \u0003 6. Policy Objectives The General Policy for the Management, Regulation and Protection of groundwater in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi aims to ensure the sustainability of groundwater reserves that are suitable for use in the future to secure water supplies and promote sustainability in water uses, and work t o reach this end through the following objectives: 1.

(5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi.\\x03rates. this depletion caused a decrease in groundwater levels and a deterioration of its quality in many areas, where 79% of it has become highly saline,18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water. the deterioration of groundwater quality affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector, which plays an important role in achieving food security and stimulating related economic activities. it also has economic consequences manifested in resorting to other water sources such as desalinated water and recycled water that requires investments for transportation and distribution . in addition, the increase of groundwater salinity leads to the need to maintain and replace irrigation networks, which increases costs for farmers. from the environmental point of view, the deterioration of the quality of groundwater and its lower level s causes the agricultural sector to depend on small desalination plants, which in turn cause various environmental impacts, such as high greenhouse gas emissions. in response to the foregoing, the emirate of abu dhabi adopts, through this policy, the necessary measures to ensure the integrated and effective use of the various water resources, through sustainable management, as well as through the regulation, management and monitoring of groundwater. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 2. scope of application this policy is implemented in the emirate of abu dhabi, and is supervised by the environment agency - abu dhabi, through consultation, coordination and cooperation with the concerned entities, whether within the governmental or the private sector, \\x03well as through analysing the economic, s ocial, environmental, technical, health and organisational impacts, based on systematic and organised procedures that contribute to achieving the objectives sought. \\x03 3. main principles underlying the policy this policy is based on several main principles related to groundwater issues: the issue main principles  groundwater alternatives encourage consumers to use alternative water sources for groundwater such as recycled water; taking into account economic, environmental, technical, organisational, social and health considerations. conservation and efficient use of groundwater ensure that all cur rent and future users maintain and rationalise groundwater use as efficiently as possible, using water demand management policies. allocation of agricultural lands allocat e lands for agricultural purposes only in non -restricted areas with long - term sustainable water resources. economic value of groundwater educat e consumers about the economic value of groundwater and the importance of preserving it and rationalising its use . research and development direct research and development as a base for future foreseeing and promoting innovative technical solutions in terms of optimal use and preservation of groundwater. emergencies groundwater is used in emergencies as an alternative source of water in such cases. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 4. legal framework article (3) of law no. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi stipulates that the environment agency - abu dhabi shall have the competence to: ‘draw up the general policy related to the management, regulation and protection of groundwater, in coordination with the entity concerned with energy in the emirate, and submit it to the executive council for approval.’ 5. analysis the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi can be summarised as follows: • groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water consumed in the emirate (groundwater atlas of abu dhabi emirate, 2018). • groundwater is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. \\x03• groundwater extraction rates in the emirate are about 24 times the rates of natural recharge. • the state of the groundwater is constantly deteriorating as the levels of deterioration in some areas have led to their classification as restricted areas. • the increasing demand for groundwater requires joint or coordinated initiatives with various stakeholders and actors involved. \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi surface aquifers are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity, and most groundwater reservoirs in the emirate are non -renewable reservoirs. because of the excessive pumping of water from these reservoirs, groundwater levels decreased and groundwater quality deteriorated in many areas, as 79% of it became highly saline water, 18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water, according to the classification of water quality depending on salinity, which was developed by the environment agency - abu dhabi. pressures the food sufficiency rate, greening the desert, and expanding parks and gardens also contribu ted to an increase of demand for irrigation water, despite the existing effort among the concerned entities on the importance and necessity of preserving groundwater and the shift in policies and legislation to focus on groundwater preservation. the low ra te of water renewal, the lack of efficient irrigation techniques and the selection of crop quality contribute to increasing pressures, and cause excessive consumption of groundwater in the emirate, as the demand for groundwater has reached unsustainable le vels, leading to its depletion and to the deterioration of its quality. the results of the groundwater well inventory project in the emirate of abu dhabi indicate that the use of groundwater in the emirate reached 2,100 million cubic meters in \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 irrigation of crops and irrigation of forests increases the demand for groundwater. the number of agricultural holdings in a bu dhabi increased by 38 times during the period from 1971 to 2019. the policies of expanding the agricultural sector, striving to achieve food security, raising \\x032017.
