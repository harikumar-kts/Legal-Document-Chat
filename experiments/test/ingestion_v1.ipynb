infigure 1supports innavigating between thesupplementary figures and information provided within thismanual : 5 section 1: overview 6 chapter 1: what is public policy? 7  the concept of ‘policy ’iscomplex, hasseveral dimensions and canlend itself todifferent interpretations .in general, apolicy isastatement thatsets outagovernment ’sintention, guiding principles, andthepractical action thatisundertaken torealise asetofdesired objectives. however, thisbroad definition needs toberefined to reflect how public policy ispracticed intheemirate ofabu dhabi .this chapter explores thedifferent types of policies and requests thatareproduced across thegovernment and provides guidance and advice onwhich should beconsidered within thescope ofthismanual andthewider public policy framework .chapter 1: what is public policy? 8policies can broadly bebroken down into three main types :‘public policies ’,‘operational policies ’and ‘organisational policies ’.the core distinction between thethree types isdefined bytheir domain (public or private) andtheimpact they have onstakeholders : •public policies arethegovernment ’schosen course ofaction, orinaction, onanissue ofpublic concern .they generate economic, social andenvironmental impacts andinvolve multiple stakeholders, including government departments, businesses, households and civil society .public policies canbeexpressed indifferent forms : visions, overarching public policies, strategies andspecific public policy interventions (figure 2). •operational policies areacourse ormethod ofaction selected byanentity todeal with operational matters when engaging with itsstakeholders .examples include facility licensing policies orissuing birth certification policies ;and, •organisational policies areacourse ormethod ofaction selected byanentity toguide anddetermine how internal human resource and financial management issues willbedealt with.they dictate rules within the entity ’sadministrative procedures .anexample ofthisisbusiness continuity policies .types of policies the government policy pyramid government policy beexpressed indifferent forms : •visions reflect thedesired future state andincludes specific priorities andideas ; •overarching public policies arederived from thegovernment ’svision and outline thehigh-level public policy positions onspecific issues ; •strategies arelong-term plans forrealising thegovernment ’svision andoverarching public policy positions; and, •public policy interventions aretargeted actions taken bythegovernment toachieve specific policy objectives .thescope ofthismanual isthedevelopment ofthislayer ofgovernment policy . when scoping and designing public policy interventions, and producing therequired business case, itis important forrequesting entities andpolicymakers tobeaware oftheinteractions between public policy and wider government and departmental strategy .assetoutearlier inthechapter, thebusiness case that requesting entities arerequired toproduce isdesigned specifically forpublic policy interventions, butin producing these cases entities willneed toconsider anddiscuss thelinkbetween theintervention andwider government strategy . figure 2: public policy pyramid the example below explains therelationship between thedifferent expressions ofpublic policy using general healthcare asanexample : tofulfil its vision doh designed several overarching public policies that address themain components ofthe abu dhabi healthcare system such asthe “doh policy on digital health ”.overarching public policiesvision thevision oftheabu dhabi department forhealth (doh) is‘ahealthy andsafe abudhabi ’. strategies doh implemented anumber ofregulatory and non regulatory public policy interventions, toexecute itshigh level policy andstrategy .forexample theestablishment of malaffi ,aninnovative, unified health information exchange (hie) platform that facilitates amore patient -centric approach tohealthcare provision.public policy interventionstorealize the above overarching public policy doh designed an ‘e-health strategy ’.this would involve setting aplan onhow toprioritize theambitions ofthedoh policy ondigital health asthe public policy pyramid indicates, public policy interventions can bederived from either the government ’soverall vision, itsoverarching public policies, oritslonger -term strategies .itisimportant thatthe proposed interventions arealigned with theoverall strategic direction oftheentity inquestion, aswellasthe priorities ofboth theemirate ofabudhabi andtheuae.inanideal scenario, each level ofgovernment action would flow from thevision and/or overarching public policies (figure 2),andthisshould bediscussed inthebusiness case .inpractice, thiswillnotalways bethe case .itshould benoted thatalternative definitions ofpublic policy exist, butthatthisisthedefinition applied forthepurposes ofthepublic policy framework . requesting entities submit many different types ofrequests toadeo andtheexecutive council, including different types ofpublic policy proposals, different non-public policy requests andarange ofother different documents forconsultation andapproval

theidentified issues .once this hasbeen determined, high -level objectives and keyperformance indicators should beidentified tosupport thepolicy analysis that takes place in thenext stage . indeveloping public policy interventions, governments respond toboth opportunities and problems .the agenda setting stage ofthepublic policy cycle isbased onaproblem -oriented approach topolicy

techniques thatcanprovide crucial insights through primary data, existing bodies ofresearch, andexperiences inother countries . establishing aclear definition ofthechallenge intheearly stages ofthepublic policy cycle isnecessary tohelp identify appropriate solutions .this process islikely tobeiterative and require different levels ofstakeholder engagement .environmental scanning, which involves identifying and tracking trends intheorganisation ’s internal andexternal environment, covers abroad range ofuseful techniques foridentifying challenges, whether they aredriven byproblems, challenges oropportunities. horizon scanning (figure 10)isauseful technique foridentifying and monitoring potentially important developments through thesystematic examination ofpotential threats and opportunities tothepolicy area in question .the approach isdriven bytheanalysis ofchanges, constants and uncertainties over defined time periods .itrequires consideration ofboth existing andemerging phenomena, butalso how different issues may interact toinfluence future outcomes .what is the nature of the challenge that needs to be addressed? 2401literature reviews :reviewing academic papers, white papers orother theoretically -backed views that study andanalyse thechallenge inquestion ; benchmarking :examining themanifestation oftheproblem inother countries, theevolution ofthe challenge andreviewing thelessons learned from elsewhere; and, primary data collection :gathering primary data from first-hand sources, such assurveys, interviews, focus groups orexperiments togenerate situation -specific insights .some core tools andtechniques thatcanbeapplied intheearly stages ofthepublic policy cycle todevelop a deep understanding ofthepolicy challenge are: figure 10: horizon scanning this three horizon model indicates how strategic andpolicy issues evolve over time: •horizon 1captures immediate strategic andpolicy priorities which arereadily apparent andmay bewellunderstood .ifnotalready, these issues should beonthepolicy agenda. •horizon 2shows thatissues may evolve, ornew issues may arise, inthemedium term.these issues, although less well understood, may present opportunities totackling emerging issues through public policy interventions . •horizon 3includes long-term strategic andpolicy issues which aredifficult todetermine from thepresent

nowh3 h2 h1 time horizonpriority 25aproblem -oriented approach topublic policy analysis isreliant onasufficiently rigorous definition ofthepolicy challenge under consideration .asmentioned atthebeginning ofthischapter, this can beachieved by deploying literature reviews, benchmarking studies orprimary data collection inorder toanswer aseries of predefined research questions . itisimportant toaskwide-ranging andprobing questions intheearly stages oftheprocess .while specific questions willvary bypolicy area, theexample research questions could be: •who isaffected? •how arethey affected? •what contributes totheproblem? •when andwhere istheproblem most likely tooccur? inaddressing these questions, itisimportant tobeasspecific aspossible about thedifferent stakeholders who areimpacted bythedifferent aspects ofthepolicy challenge .the following table highlights thekeyinternal andexternal stakeholders toconsider when identifying theimpacted parties during intervention analysis. table 2: stakeholders thestakeholders listed intable 2aredeliberately defined atahigh-level, andinpractice willneed tobefurther broken down through segmentation and/or demographic analysis .aparticular policy issue islikely toimpact specific groups more than others, andidentifying thespecific agents impacted byapublic policy isakeypartof theearly analysis. atthisstage itisparticularly important toperform stakeholder mapping . additional research into thenature ofthechallenge should also consider thespecific context, history and potential evolution oftheidentified problem(s) .research questions tosupport thisadditional assessment could include: •what isthehistory ofthechallenge? •who putthischallenge ontheagenda? •what arethespecific interests atstake (including demographic, geographic andsectoral)? •who isinvolved inthedecision -making? through detailed research andanalysis ofthequestions thataresetoutthroughout thischapter, requesting entities willbeable toprovide proportionate, well-reasoned evidence ofthenature andtype ofproblem(s) or challenge(s) . businesses economic stakeholders engaged in commercial, industrial, or professional activities, who transform factors of production into goods and services. households economic stakeholders who supply factors of production (labour and capital) and are consumers of final goods and services. civil societyindividuals or groups who share a common interest and are not connected to the government. civil society organisations can mediate the relationships between public authorities and citizens. government entities engaged in public sector activities which pass laws, collect revenues and directly consume economic goods and services.description stakeholder thebreadth ofissues covered bypolicy -makers often means thatachallenge may beidentified before thefull- scale orsizeisunderstood .theprimary purpose ofthisstep istoestablish aquantitative understanding ofthe challenge .this willrequire aninitial estimation ofthesize and anunderstanding ofthedemographic, geographic orsectoral variation, aswell asabalance between targeted analysis ofspecific questions with exploratory analysis toreveal anyunknown characteristics ofthechallenge .what is the size of the challenge that needs to be addressed? this willrequire arange ofdata sources, including national statistics, departmental data, proprietary data sources andprimary data.thecollection ofprimary data canbeparticularly important atthisstage because itis likely tobethemost specific information about thearea inquestion, however itcanbemore time consuming to collect andanalyse . policy challenges willoften draw onarange ofaggregate estimates, including both monetary and non- monetary aggregates .monetary statistics include market oreconomic valuations, where asnon-monetary statistics include measures offrequency, prevalence andcount, andpercentages . tounderstand thepolicy challenge itmay benecessary todisaggregate overall estimates bydifferent characteristics .this caninclude demographic, geographic andsectoral analysis . aggregate statistics may hide important characteristics ofthechallenge .consequently, itisimportant tolook beyond aggregates tounderstand measures ofvariation .this includes central tendency (mean, median, and mode), dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), andposition (percentile, quartile andrank) . different types ofdata analysis canbeused depending onthesalience ofthepolicy area, availability ofdata, and urgency oftherequest .methods range from descriptive statistics and trend analysis, tomore complex economic orstatistical assessments .forexample, supply and demand analysis (figure 11)isparticularly useful forchallenges with implications formarket outcomes, participants orstructures, asitsupports the understanding ofthedynamics anddeterminants ofsupply anddemand .this technique canalso beadjusted toexamine both capacity andneeds, which provides anunconstrainted economic assessment ofthesupply or demand inagiven market . 2702 what data are available? what aggregate statistics are required to understand the size of the challenge? what disaggregated statistics are required to understand the size of the challenge? what measures of variation are required to understand the characteristics of the challenge? figure 11:

estimating thesizeandscale ofaproblem assists withthecreation ofacounterfactual, or‘business asusual ’, scenario during thedesign andappraise stage .this isdescribed inmore detail inchapter

orthecounterfactual .once thescale oftheproblem hasbeen assessed, itispossible tostart toanalyse theunderlying drivers ofthe challenge orproblem inquestion. alogic tree isatool used tobreak down aproblem statement orquestion into itsmore simple subcomponents, allowing foreasier identification ofpotential rootcauses .theapproach helps togroup thecauses anddrills down further intothedetails ofeach grouping until each issue issufficiently explicit . this means theissues must bemutually exclusive andcollectively exhaustive (mece) . •'mutually exclusive ’indicates thatthere isnooverlap between thesubcomponents •'collectively exhaustive ’means thatthelogic treecovers allpotential rootcauses this exercise willprove helpful when identifying solutions toaddress theproblem statement, as responses may tackle theactual problem statement ortheindividual issues defining thecauses. asimple example ofalogic treeisoutlined below :what are the underlying drivers behind this challenge? acomprehensive problem analysis does notonly reveal thenature, sizeandlikely evolution ofaproblem, but isalso anindication ofthelikely causal -effect relationships that may beunderlying it.there anumber of methodologies andtechniques thatcanbedeployed atthisstage, ranging from qualitative problem solving tools, such asaroot cause analysis, oradvanced econometric orstatistical techniques .logic tree analysis (figure 12)isoneofseveral methodologies thatcanbeapplied tounderstand thedrivers behind aproblem . figure 12: logic tree analysis issue 1 sub-issue 1.1 sub-issue 1.2issue 2

issues should betackled asapriority . driver mapping isused tomap thedrivers ofapolicy challenge based ontheir importance tothepolicy area andthecertainty ofoutcome . consider thedrivers ofthechallenges identified through others means, such aslogic treeorthe analysis ofsupply ordemand, butalso consider wider factors through using thepolitical, economic, sociological, technological, legal andenvironmental (pestle) framework . map thedrivers based onimportance and certainty oftheoutcome, asshown intheexample below :eeconomic ssocietalppolitical ttechnological llegislative

oftheproblem(s) orissue(s) thatareat hand .the next partnow focusses onwhether government intervention isthebest option foraddressing them, andbrings these different assessments together .figure 13: driver mapping 3001 02 why is government intervention required? identifying aproblem, highlighting thesizeandscale oftheissue, andidentifying therootcauses ofthe challenge arenotsufficient ontheir own towarrant agovernment response .before government intervention canbejustified, itisimportant toshowcase why government action isthebest way of dealing with theidentified problem and what would happen ifnoaction istaken .there isnosingle approach tojustifying government intervention, anditisimportant toconsider arange ofperspectives, including what would happen ifnointervention were totake place . 31013.2 establish the rationale for government intervention legalistic analysis oftheneed forgovernment intervention isoneapproach, andincludes addressing questions such as: •isthere alegal basis forgovernment intervention? •isgovernment intervention proportional tothesizeoftheproblem? •isthepolicy area under theexclusive competence ofthegovernment ordepartment? itisalso possible tojustify government intervention onthebasis ofeconomic grounds, including to address regulatory failure, market failure, ortopromote social orpublic goals .forexample, theuseof logic trees may indicate thattheroot cause oftheissue isdriven byinappropriate regulatory design, leading toeconomic distortions andinefficient economic outcomes .three examples ofpossible triggers forgovernment intervention areprovided infigure 14. market failure market failure usually arises when thecurrent market system failstoefficiently allocate goods orservices .forexample :regulatory failure this can occur when regulations are not well - designed to address an issue and they result in unintended consequences. this can lead to costs for businesses and/or society. social goals government intervention may be required in order to address distributional or equality objectives, or advance specific priorities for the public good. figure 14: triggers for government intervention 320301 02public goods :these are non-excludable (can be consumed byallwithout restriction) and non-rivalrous (can beconsumed byanynumber ofindividuals with no impact onbenefits) .they aretypically notprovided by markets (for example defense services) without government intervention . imperfect information :information isneeded for markets tooperate efficiently .regulation may be needed toenforce information disclosure, forexample : providing terms andconditions when rendering services orproviding price transparency onreceipts . externalities :these arethesocial costs and benefits thatarise from economic activities which areincurred by athird party who has nocontrol over thedecision to create that cost orbenefit .forexample, thecost of pollution isfeltbythepublic rather than theindustry responsible forcreating it. market power :this occurs when there isinsufficient competition inthemarket, due toeither thenumber of firms ormarket share offirms, resulting ininefficient prices, inadequate competition and consumer choice, bundling goods orservices, and dead weight loss.for example, amarket which isdominated byonefirmmay result inunjustifiably high consumer prices. the various techniques highlighted throughout thischapter aredesigned tohelp requesting entities identify problems across allpolicy areas, assess them effectively, and toidentify whether government intervention is required .the final partofthischapter addresses how toseteffective objectives andperformance indicators in order totackle theproblems thathave been identified above . term definition example outputsthe products, services or capital goods that result from an intervention.establish a 24-hour service for customer support by 2021 outcomesthe expected effects of interventions outputs.50% reduction in the number of complaints received by 2025 itisimportant toengage with stakeholders throughout thisprocess toensure thatthevision andobjectives are aligned between therequesting entity, thewider abu dhabi government and theuae government .when identifying theobjectives, stakeholders should beconsulted andbenchmarking should beconducted . when setting objectives, itisrecommended to: 1.consider alignment withstrategy ; 2.engage stakeholders onobjectives; and 3.ensure objectives follow thesmart framework .3.3 define the desired objective(s) when defining theobjectives ofapublic policy intervention, itisimportant toreflect how they willcontribute to achieving thegovernment ’soverarching priorities .such objectives may beexpressed asoutputs oroutcomes andshould bealigned tothegovernment ’soverall

thefollowing questions foreach level ofgovernment : •what isthemission andpurpose? •what isthevision andstrategy? •what arethetarget outcomes?consider alignment with strategy 3301 itisalso important toconsider how theobjectives might impact thestrategy ofother government departments, particularly where thepolicy area islikely torequire collaboration withthedepartments inquestion . the absence ofclearly defined objectives may lead toimproper policy selection, ineffective appraisals, and subsequently ineffective policies .thesmart framework (figure 16)provides guidance oncharacteristics that contribute towell-defined objectives .engage stakeholders on objectives figure 15: engaging stakeholders on objectives the following questions may beuseful tohelp develop anunderstanding ofthespecific policy area, the emerging themes thatneed tobeaddressed andthepotential sources ofconflict : what is the critical issue for the area being considered? what is a favourable outcome? what is an

same objective may result in different magnitudes of impact depending on the behavioural change they generate. for example, depending on the specific case, fiscal instruments may be expected to generate larger changes in behaviour than information provision resulting in larger overall impacts. scope of interventionthe scope of a potential intervention identifies stakeholders who will be targeted, and the geographical location in which the proposed intervention will apply. typically, a policy that targets a larger stakeholder group or geographical location would be expected to generate a larger impact. duration of interventionin some cases, the direct effect of an intervention on the criteria may be positive, whilst the indirect effects are negative. for example, an intervention may increase employment in one sector but decrease it in another. in this case, the overall effect should be used to determine the direction of impact. likelihood of impact occurringsome impacts are more certain to occur than others. mca provides aconsistent and standardised means ofcomparing options. the final scores calculated can therefore becompared tohelp select thepreferred

it is important to remember that impacts should always be measured in relation to the counterfactual. this is the scenario which would have occurred if the intervention had not been put in place, and the world had continued with business as usual (bau). impact should always be compared to the counterfactual to avoid overstating or understating the potential impact.*this step is only required if further evidence is requested after pre -approval* *this step is only required if further evidence is requested after pre -approval* there areanumber ofother considerations which should also betaken into account when conducting quantitative analysis .these aresetoutinmore detail figures 30and31. figure 30: making and logging assumptions quantitative analysis usually involves making several assumptions. these may include: these should be clearly documented in an assumptions tracker, with ratings or commentary to indicate how likely the assumptions are to be true, and how large an impact they will have on the results. an example assumptions tracker is provided below: # descriptionhow likely is the assumption to be true?how significant is the assumption to the overall result? 1price elasticity of demand for sugary drinksm h 2time and resources to comply with administrative requestsh l 3 expected rate of compliance m lassumptions on the nature of the proposed intervention; assumptions in any primary data collection; assumptions in any studies used from literature; assumptions in any adjustments made to apply the data to the proposed intervention; assumptions to account

:public policy interventions generally require participation from several different stakeholders, anditisimportant toalign with these organisations early intheprocess toensure thesuccessful implementation ofanyintervention. this includes internal communications within theentity, andexternal communications with other organisations, theprivate sector and, where necessary, citizens andconsumers .allstakeholder maps should also bereviewed alongside thefinal implementation plan, andanynew stakeholders should bemade aware oftheir roleandhow thepolicy may affect them ; •raise public awareness :one ofthebiggest risks thatcould cause issues during implementation isthe absence ofacommon understanding amongst thegeneral public ontheupcoming changes .assuch, developing aninformation and/or marketing plan toraise awareness within therelevant communities in advance ofthelaunch ofthepolicy isvital; •establish policy governance :some policies may require theformation ofcommittees, while others may require theformation ofateam, sector, ordepartment .regardless ofwhat therequirement is,forming the governance required forimplementation must becovered before thepublic policy intervention islaunched ; and •deliver and confirm implementation requirements :allrequirements identified forthepre-launch stage willbecompleted toensure effective implementation .this includes theallocation ofbudget andfinance andtheprovision ofadditional resources andskills .this may also involve tasks likeobtaining proposals from vendors orsuppliers . 5.2 launch and execute the policy the approved option should bedelivered inaccordance with theimplementation plan, themonitoring and evaluation plan, andanyriskmitigation plans thathave been created .these plans areallcovered inmore detail inearlier parts ofthismanual . 72the risks identified during thedesign and appraise stage willneed tobemanaged once apublic policy intervention isimplemented, and risk registers and risk cards should bemade available toallkey stakeholders responsible forimplementation. theimplementation plan should have considered how best to mitigate these risks, andatthisstage those who aretasked withdelivery should have robust plans inplace . once thepublic policy intervention islaunched, itsdelivery should beclearly announced and actively monitored .this enables improved functioning and data tracking oftheintervention, which iscritical to conducting arobust, detailed evaluation attheappropriate time.there areseveral ways thatthiscanbe done, andfurther information isprovided inchapter

and, attheright time, evaluate itsoverall impact .asthefourth and final step inthepublic policy cycle, itisintended toprovide policy -makers with objective analysis andinsights toinform future decision -making . within thepublic policy cycle, monitoring and evaluation have distinct butinterrelated roles (figure 37). broadly speaking, monitoring isacontinuous process, while fullevaluations take place atkeymilestones. figure 36: monitor and evaluate stage overview stage of the public policy cycle adeo interaction (* = indicates mandatory step) 1 agenda setting 3 implement 4 monitor and evaluate2 design and appraise evaluationhow do we ensure this is still the best way? evaluate the policy 4.2monitor policy implementation 4.1 figure 37: monitor and evaluate goals monitor: this involves the frequent collection of data related to the intervention and can be used to assess progress. monitoring sets the foundation on which an evaluation can take place, as proper evaluation is reliant on adequate data and information. evaluate: adetailed public policy assessment uses theavailable information toexamine apolicy ’sdesign, functionality andability to meet itsobjectives andoutputs .together, monitoring and evaluation activities assess the key aspects of any policy intervention, and are ultimately used to determine how successful the policy intervention has been, and what improvements can be made. the remainder ofthischapter willprovide advice, guidance andanoverview ofdifferent tools andtechniques thatcanbeused tosupport policy -makers intheir monitoring andevaluation activity .thechapter issplitintotwo core parts : 1. monitor policy implementation 2. evaluate thepolicy before designing amonitoring andevaluation strategy, itisimportant toconsider itspurpose andimportance for thewider public policy cycle .this helps toprovide aframework onwhich toplan thespecific monitoring and evaluation activities that need totake place and ensures thatthey areadapted tothespecifics ofthepolicy intervention being assessed . why is public policy evaluation important? 01 evaluating public policy interventions isavital partofthedevelopment process because itallows policy -makers andthewider public tounderstand theimpacts ofchanges andallows thelessons learned tobeentered intothe evidence base used todevelop future policies .astrong public policy evaluation programme results intwokey outcomes :improved learning andincreased accountability . learning :through monitoring and evaluation, policy makers can gauge whether theimplemented intervention isproducing theimpacts that itwas forecast to.intheearly stages ofapolicy ’s implementation, learning canhelp adapt thepolicy ’sdesign toimprove itsfunctionality andperformance . insome cases, pilots ofapublic policy intervention areheld totestthepolicy ’sdesign inacontrolled setting, andthelearnings from thepilot caninform itsdevelopment forlarger scale interventions .itis important totake learnings from both successful andunsuccessful interventions, asboth provide insights which canbeuseful forfuture interventions . accountability :evaluating public policy helps tohold thegovernment andpublic sector toaccount for thechanges thatthey have made .this includes ensuring thatgovernment money isspent inaprudent and transparent manner, and that policies deliver theresults that they have were designed to.by evaluating theresults ofanintervention, thegovernment candemonstrate thatitisacting inthepublic interest and informing thepublic oftheresults itisachieving .this helps tobuild trust between government andthepublic andcanhelp improve compliance ifthepublic iswellinformed ofthepurpose andresults ofaparticular initiative. what is a successful public policy evaluation? 02 asuccessful public policy evaluation results inaholistic assessment ofanintervention ’seffects, andoutlines what canbelearned from itsdesign andimplementation .inorder todevelop thisassessment, anintervention should bemonitored throughout itsimplementation, from early stages tothepoint theevaluation takes place . effective monitoring and evaluation should provide insights across several stages oftheintervention ’slogic model (figure 38). figure 38: impact evaluation effective monitoring and evaluation should assess different dimensions oftheintervention .there aremany different potential dimensions, and policy -makers should select those that aremost relevant totheir specific policy, butallevaluations intheemirate ofabudhabi should include atleast thefollowing : 77outputs activitiesinputs inputs inputsoutcomes outcomes outcomes inputs : resources that feed into the policy ’s activities or processes, and are generally straightforward and easy to identify, such as financials, employees, equipment, systemsactivities: actions, activities, or processes undertaken as part of the policy ’s implementation. outputs: the products, services or capital goods that result from an intervention, such as number of families who attended an awareness programme, or number of households that have been visitedoutcomes: the expected effects of an intervention's outputs. typically, observable and measurable indicators to measure progress, and that have predefined targets to determine desired levels (for example: % reduction in smoking) relevance focuses onassessing theextent towhich theobjectives anddesign stillmeet theneeds and problems itsought toaddress .this requires reviewing theimportance oftheintervention byreassessing itsusefulness intackling theidentified problem atthetime oftheevaluation (future state) .astime goes by,theoverall circumstances may have changed andhence theinitially identified problems may also have changed ascompared towhen thepolicy was initially designed .analysing any misalignment between theneed atthetime oftheevaluation andthepolicy objectives would support inidentifying the relevance ofthepolicy being assessed ; effectiveness links thepublic policy intervention toitsdesired objectives byassessing thesuccess of theintervention inachieving orprogressing towards these goals .the objectives defined during the agenda setting stage canbeused askpis ; efficiency weighs thecosts being incurred bythepublic policy intervention andtheactual change ithas achieved .this canbeassessed using acost-benefit analysis ofthecosts thathave resulted from the public policy intervention andcomparing these tothechanges ithasactually ledto(changes canbe positive ornegative) ;and, impact, oradded value, assesses theactual impacts against those estimated during theappraisal stage ofthepolicy development cycle .exceeding theestimated positive impacts (benefits) isconsidered a success, while exceeding negative impacts (costs) would reveal that they were potentially underestimated during thepolicy development cycle . forexample, some keyquestions apublic policy evaluation cananswer are: ●how istheintervention operating inpractice compared tohow itwasdesigned tooperate? ●which groups aremost affected bytheintervention, andwhich groups areleast affected? ●isthepolicy delivering within budget? ●how aretheimpacts oftheintervention feltacross different stakeholders? ●what improvements can bemade tohelp the policy deliver better results ormitigate unintended consequences? every monitoring andevaluation strategy should consider both thestages anddimensions oftheintervention anditsintended impacts when framing thestrategy .allother parts ofthestrategy anddata requirements will flow from aclear understanding ofwhat success looks likefortheintervention ateach stage andacross each dimension . monitoring apublic policy intervention sets thefoundation onwhich evaluation can take place, asproper evaluation isreliant onadequate data and robust information .one oftheaims ofthemonitoring step isto examine what changes have occurred since theimplementation ofanintervention. itisgenerally recommended torecord thefollowing aspects : •implementation :how closely theimplementation plan (asdeveloped during thedesign andappraise stage) wasfollowed; •application :theextent towhich thepolicy met itsobjectives and theways inwhich theintervention has triggered change ; •compliance andenforcement :level ofcompliance bystakeholders involved ;and •contextual information :additional information that may notbedirectly related totheintervention but provides wider context (forexample :economic growth andnew technologies) . there areseveral important steps that need tobefollowed toensure that apublic policy intervention is monitored effectively, andtoensure thatthecorrect data areavailable fortheevaluation .these aresetoutin more detail below .6.1 monitor policy implementation develop a plan early 01 developing aplan tomonitor apublic policy intervention early intheintervention ’sdevelopment isessential toa successful evaluation .amonitoring plan should bealigned with theobjectives ofapublic policy intervention, so thatthedata thatiscollected isrelevant totheintervention ’sstated goals .further information onthese plans is available inchapter 5. set data requirements 02 itisessential togather baseline data before apolicy intervention isimplemented, sothat theeffects ofthe intervention canbemeasured against historic performance before theintervention took place .this allows policy makers tocompare data andperformance measures ofthenew policy intervention with past results, tomeasure theimpact theintervention hadcompared toaworld inwhich itdidnottake place . figure 39: general data types qualitative data this refers to data that is descriptive, and is collected through methods like interviews, observations and focus groups. while such data may be converted into a numerical value, it can be more difficult to analyse. example: survey comments, focus groups minutes, questionnaire responsesquantitative data this refers to data that is in numerical form that may be collected through surveys, models, experiments, or measurements. such data are objective and suitable for statistical analysis, and consequently easier to compare. example: age of participants, data collected from businesses, experiment findings, admin data table 7: types of monitoring data data type uses people accessing aservice assessing whether an intervention is reaching its target population process data assessing whether intervention was implemented as intended input dataassessing whether inputs required met expectations and confirming assumptions of requirements were correct output data assessing whether the programme has delivered target outputs outcome data measuring benefits of delivering outputsselect relevant dataitisalso important tonote that thepublic policy intervention should bemonitored both during and after implementation .collecting data during implementation allows policy makers tocapture theinitial effects ofthe intervention, andmeasure how theintervention performs over itslifecycle .this cancapture theamount oftime it takes foranintervention to‘scale up’,and initial take-upand compliance rates .continuing tomonitor an intervention after itsimplementation iskeytounderstanding how well theintervention works inthelong term, including whether theinitial effects oftheimplementation become more subdued over thepolicy ’slifecycle and whether there areanylong term behavioural responses totheintervention . thetype andquantity ofdata thatneeds tobecollected willdepend onthetype ofintervention, andisbased on theindicators defined inthedesign and appraise stage ofthepublic policy cycle .there aretwo main categories ofdata thatcanbecollected tohelp support apolicy evaluation : the quality ofthedata thatisrecorded hasadirect effect onthequality ofanintervention ’sevaluation, and consequently theconclusions that can bedrawn regarding thepolicy ’seffectiveness. itistherefore very important togather complete, relevant and accurate data.itisalso important toreference chapter 5,where further information isprovided onmonitoring andevaluation plans .data canbecollected using anumber of different methods and tools .insome cases, standard monitoring data canfulfill thedata needs forapolicy evaluation .this isgenerally quantitative andused totrack theimplementation ofapublic policy intervention . table 7below sets outsome oftheways standard monitoring data canbecollected. 79 insome cases, standard monitoring data canfulfill thedata needs forapolicy evaluation .however, incases where regular monitoring information isinsufficient, bespoke surveys orquestionnaires should beused to acquire thenecessary data andintelligence .when designing surveys, itisimportant toconsider thefollowing points : •clearly clarify thegoal orobjective from thesurvey, thetarget group thatwillbeaddressed, andthesurvey method most appropriate forthetarget group ; •determine thetype ofdata thatisrequired forcollection .there arefivemain data types asshown intable 8; table 8: types of survey data data type information collected factual factual information about respondents, such

istoidentify and assess thedifferent stakeholders that anentity willneed to interact withinorder togather thisinformation andinsight . identify relevant stakeholders 03 stakeholders have akeyroletoplay inthemonitoring andevaluation ofapublic policy intervention, ranging from thecollection ofdata tousing theevaluation todevelop future policies .when developing amonitoring plan, itis important toidentify inadvance theroles each stakeholder willplay intheoverall evaluation that isbeing undertaken, their objectives inthepolicy process andtheir skills andcapacity .table 12sets

interventions to inform future changesboth informs future policy via lessons from previous interventions .2 evaluate the policy examine the existing evidence base 01 having athorough understanding ofthepublic policy intervention isessential toanyevaluation .asthefirstpart ofevaluation scoping, policy makers should outline how theintervention was expected towork inpractice, the assumptions underlying theintervention's design, and thewider context inwhich itoperated .this involves examining theevidence base behind thepolicy intervention, andidentifying where gaps orweaknesses inthe evidence base exist.inidentifying gaps intheevidence base, policy makers canbetter understand thequestions theevaluation needs toanswer . set out the purpose of the evaluation 02 asuccessful evaluation willhave clearly set-outthequestions thatitintends toanswer, andhow those answers willbeused forfuture policy development .this includes setting outwho willbeusing theevaluation findings, andwhen .there areseveral different ways inwhich anevaluation canbeused, including : •communicating anintervention ’simpact tothepublic •risk identification •measuring progress towards intended benefits •informing future decision making (forexample, regulatory changes, larger rollouts) •stakeholder engagement itisalso important toreview theobjectives andgoals thatwere setoutduring thedesign stage ofthepublic policy intervention, asthese should play amajor partinhelping toscope theevaluation . choose the type of evaluation that is required 03 there arethree broad types ofevaluations :process, impact andvalue -for-money .each type ofevaluation is designed toproduce different information andresults, andeach should beused atdifferent points during the lifetime ofanindividual policy intervention .table 13provides adescription ofeach type ofevaluation .when undertaking anevaluation ofapublic policy intervention, itisimportant tohave aclear understanding of thepurpose oftheevaluation and what isrequired toachieve thepredefined goals oroutputs .evaluation scoping istheprocess foridentifying themain purpose ofthereview and what isneeded toconduct the evaluation successfully .thegoals ofevaluation scoping areto: 1. examine theexisting evidence base 2. setoutthepurpose oftheevaluation 3. choose thetype ofevaluation thatisrequired the goals ofanevaluation willvary depending onthespecific policy inquestion, andtheoverall aims ofthe exercise .these steps arediscussed inmore detail below : undertake the evaluation 04there aremany factors toconsider when choosing themost appropriate type ofevaluation .themost important ofthese factors istiming, asthelength oftime thatapolicy hasbeen implemented islikely todictate which sort ofevaluation ismost appropriate .inmost instances, a‘process evaluation ’should beundertaken quite soon after theintervention hasbeen implemented, while an‘impact ’or‘value -for-money ’assessment would take place once thepolicy hasbeen inplace forseveral years . the choice ofevaluation type should also consider theuncertainties and assumptions intheintervention ’s evidence base, andtheneeds ofstakeholders, who would have been involved intheselection ofmethods to manage expectations and agree onobjectives .this willhelp manage expectations and ensure thefinal evaluation meets theneeds ofthose stakeholders . the selection ofthetype ofevaluation should also consider thetime andresources available toconduct the evaluation .evaluation types range intheir time andresource intensity, andpolicy makers should berealistic about thecapacity toconduct anevaluation .evaluation type goal ofevaluation questions answered process evaluationwhat can be learned from how the evaluation was delivered?was it delivered as planned? did it function as planned? did the context influence how it was delivered? how could its delivery be improved in the future? impact evaluationwhat difference did the intervention make?did it achieve expected outcomes? was the intervention decisive in the change in outcomes? can the intervention be replicated? value -for- money evaluationwas the intervention a good use of public resources?was the intervention cost effective? what were the costs and benefits? how would the intervention compare to alternatives? when running anevaluation, itisimportant toconsider thatthere areseveral different methodologies thatcould bedeployed .different methodologies canbeused tosuitprocess, impact andvalue formoney evaluations, with varying amounts oftime andresource requirements .forexample, process andimpact evaluations should make useofinterviews, focus groups, surveys, performance monitoring, andobservational studies .each have their own benefits andlimitations (table 14). 84table 13: types of evaluation disseminate the results 05impact evaluations, which look forcausal relationships from anintervention, often make useofexperimental or quasi -experimental studies .these types ofevaluation usemethods such asrandomized control trials (rcts), difference -in-difference analysis, orregression discontinuity design .these methods areacademically rigorous and, when designed properly, canprovide arobust evidence base toassess theefficacy ofanintervention . however, they require asignificant amount oftime and resource tocomplete, typically with subject matter experts doing highly skilled research .often, itmay notbepossible orethical toseparate participants into experimental and control groups, and thedata may notbeavailable toconduct thestudy inaway which produces verifiable andnon-biased results . thedissemination andreporting oftheresults ofanevaluation torelevant stakeholders isakeystep toensure thecontinuous improvement ofpublic policy making, and toallow forearly responses toany issues or unintended results that have been identified .itisimportant tobuild apublic sector evaluation culture that encourages reflection, collaboration, revision andtransparency .table 14: evaluation methodologies 85method of evaluation benefits drawbacks interviews / focus groups allows for context time intensive; not quantitative case studies in depth difficult to make findings generalizable surveys useful for statistical analysisless in depth; response rate issues can limit generalizability output monitoring low cost; fast can be inconvenient for participants and staff observational studies allows for understanding of individual experience‘hawthorne effect ’ can mean participants act differently as they are conscious that they are being observed the structure, frequency, andlevel ofdetail thatisreported willdepend ontheaudience andthenature ofthe policy .forinstance, reports prepared fortheimplementation team may require more details compared toreports prepared forsenior officials, ororganisational leadership . itistherefore important tounderstand thedifference between direct andindirect stakeholders, astheir usage of theresults willvary considerably .forthepurposes ofanevaluation, direct stakeholders aretypically those who aredeveloping, implementing orinspecting apublic policy intervention andmake useofevaluations toimprove design and implementation orevaluate effectiveness ofoutcomes .indirect stakeholders arethose who have been involved ineither theconsultation ormonitoring process during thedevelopment oftheintervention .define the audience 86present the results asdiscussed earlier inthischapter, there arevarious endusers ofevaluation reports andfindings, andthese different groups willmake useoftheresults indifferent ways .asaresult, astandard written highlights report may notbethebest dissemination option inallcases. itisimportant totailor results based ontheintended stakeholder, such asthrough theuseofone-pagers, infographics orsuccinct slide decks . there areseveral different ways toproduce ahigh quality summary report, andpolicy -makers should choose the best medium fortheintervention inquestion. ataminimum, areport should include: the policy ’s desired objectives; details on how the public policy intervention has worked in practice; summary of the findings, performance of indicators against the predefined targets, and conclusions based on the findings, which could include any of the following: •no changes to the policy are required, and it should continue as planned; •some action is required to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved; •policy must be revised due to adverse impact; or •policy may need to be terminated. iffurther

(5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi.\\x03rates. this depletion caused a decrease in groundwater levels and a deterioration of its quality in many areas, where 79% of it has become highly saline,18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water. the deterioration of groundwater quality affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector, which plays an important role in achieving food security and stimulating related economic activities. it also has economic consequences manifested in resorting to other water sources such as desalinated water and recycled water that requires investments for transportation and distribution . in addition, the increase of groundwater salinity leads to the need to maintain and replace irrigation networks, which increases costs for farmers. from the environmental point of view, the deterioration of the quality of groundwater and its lower level s causes the agricultural sector to depend on small desalination plants, which in turn cause various environmental impacts, such as high greenhouse gas emissions. in response to the foregoing, the emirate of abu dhabi adopts, through this policy, the necessary measures to ensure the integrated and effective use of the various water resources, through sustainable management, as well as through the regulation, management and monitoring of groundwater. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 2. scope of application this policy is implemented in the emirate of abu dhabi, and is supervised by the environment agency - abu dhabi, through consultation, coordination and cooperation with the concerned entities, whether within the governmental or the private sector, \\x03well as through analysing the economic, s ocial, environmental, technical, health and organisational impacts, based on systematic and organised procedures that contribute to achieving the objectives sought. \\x03 3. main principles underlying the policy this policy is based on several main principles related to groundwater issues: the issue main principles  groundwater alternatives encourage consumers to use alternative water sources for groundwater such as recycled water; taking into account economic, environmental, technical, organisational, social and health considerations. conservation and efficient use of groundwater ensure that all cur rent and future users maintain and rationalise groundwater use as efficiently as possible, using water demand management policies. allocation of agricultural lands allocat e lands for agricultural purposes only in non -restricted areas with long - term sustainable water resources. economic value of groundwater educat e consumers about the economic value of groundwater and the importance of preserving it and rationalising its use . research and development direct research and development as a base for future foreseeing and promoting innovative technical solutions in terms of optimal use and preservation of groundwater. emergencies groundwater is used in emergencies as an alternative source of water in such cases. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 4. legal framework article (3) of law no. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi stipulates that the environment agency - abu dhabi shall have the competence to: “draw up the general policy related to the management, regulation and protection of groundwater, in coordination with the entity concerned with energy in the emirate, and submit it to the executive council for approval.” 5. analysis the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi can be summarised as follows: • groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water consumed in the emirate (groundwater atlas of abu dhabi emirate, 2018). • groundwater is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. \\x03• groundwater extraction rates in the emirate are about 24 times the rates of natural recharge. • the state of the groundwater is constantly deteriorating as the levels of deterioration in some areas have led to their classification as restricted areas. • the increasing demand for groundwater requires joint or coordinated initiatives with various stakeholders and actors involved. \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi surface aquifers are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity, and most groundwater reservoirs in the emirate are non -renewable reservoirs. because of the excessive pumping of water from these reservoirs, groundwater levels decreased and groundwater quality deteriorated in many areas, as 79% of it became highly saline water, 18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water, according to the classification of water quality depending on salinity, which was developed by the environment agency - abu dhabi. pressures the food sufficiency rate, greening the desert, and expanding parks and gardens also contribu ted to an increase of demand for irrigation water, despite the existing effort among the concerned entities on the importance and necessity of preserving groundwater and the shift in policies and legislation to focus on groundwater preservation. the low ra te of water renewal, the lack of efficient irrigation techniques and the selection of crop quality contribute to increasing pressures, and cause excessive consumption of groundwater in the emirate, as the demand for groundwater has reached unsustainable le vels, leading to its depletion and to the deterioration of its quality. the results of the groundwater well inventory project in the emirate of abu dhabi indicate that the use of groundwater in the emirate reached 2,100 million cubic meters in \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 irrigation of crops and irrigation of forests increases the demand for groundwater. the number of agricultural holdings in a bu dhabi increased by 38 times during the period from 1971 to 2019. the policies of expanding the agricultural sector, striving to achieve food security, raising \\x032017.
