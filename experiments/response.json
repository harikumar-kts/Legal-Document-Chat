(182) of 2022 concerning the general policy for the management, regulation and protection of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi the executive council has decided the following: the general policy for the management, regulation and protection of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi shall be approved in accordance with the (attached form). issuance date: 13 december 2022 corresponding to: 19 jumada al owla 1444 hijrisaif saeed ghobash secretary-general \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 \\x03  \\x03 general policy for the management, regulation and protection of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi environment agency - abu dhabi. 2022. 1. introduction this policy reviews the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi and the challenges and implications of its depletion. one of the major challenges facing groundwater is the depletion of the reservoir as that the extraction rates exceed the natural recharge \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 it also defines its underlying principles and the relevant legal framework. groundwater is one of the main natural resources, and the ratio of the total use of freshwater (which includes both surface water and fossil groundwater) out of the total renewable water resources available is one of the indicators by which water scarcity is measured, taking into account that the results are equalised through a weight that is determined to reflect the use of desalinated water and treated wastewater. in this context, although the water scarcity index in the emirate is one of the lowest in the world, the emirate records one of the h ighest rates of per capita water consumption. most groundwater resources are surface aquifers, which are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity. most of the groundwater reservoirs in the emirate are non - renewable. groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water resources consumed in the emirate and is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. the policy is drawn up in implementation of the provisions of law no. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi.\\x03rates. this depletion caused a decrease in groundwater levels and a deterioration of its quality in many areas, where 79% of it has become highly saline,18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water. the deterioration of groundwater quality affects its use, especially in the agricultural sector, which plays an important role in achieving food security and stimulating related economic activities. it also has economic consequences manifested in resorting to other water sources such as desalinated water and recycled water that requires investments for transportation and distribution . in addition, the increase of groundwater salinity leads to the need to maintain and replace irrigation networks, which increases costs for farmers. from the environmental point of view, the deterioration of the quality of groundwater and its lower level s causes the agricultural sector to depend on small desalination plants, which in turn cause various environmental impacts, such as high greenhouse gas emissions. in response to the foregoing, the emirate of abu dhabi adopts, through this policy, the necessary measures to ensure the integrated and effective use of the various water resources, through sustainable management, as well as through the regulation, management and monitoring of groundwater. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 2. scope of application this policy is implemented in the emirate of abu dhabi, and is supervised by the environment agency - abu dhabi, through consultation, coordination and cooperation with the concerned entities, whether within the governmental or the private sector, \\x03well as through analysing the economic, s ocial, environmental, technical, health and organisational impacts, based on systematic and organised procedures that contribute to achieving the objectives sought. \\x03 3. main principles underlying the policy this policy is based on several main principles related to groundwater issues: the issue main principles  groundwater alternatives encourage consumers to use alternative water sources for groundwater such as recycled water; taking into account economic, environmental, technical, organisational, social and health considerations. conservation and efficient use of groundwater ensure that all cur rent and future users maintain and rationalise groundwater use as efficiently as possible, using water demand management policies. allocation of agricultural lands allocat e lands for agricultural purposes only in non -restricted areas with long - term sustainable water resources. economic value of groundwater educat e consumers about the economic value of groundwater and the importance of preserving it and rationalising its use . research and development direct research and development as a base for future foreseeing and promoting innovative technical solutions in terms of optimal use and preservation of groundwater. emergencies groundwater is used in emergencies as an alternative source of water in such cases. \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 4. legal framework article (3) of law no. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi stipulates that the environment agency - abu dhabi shall have the competence to: ‘draw up the general policy related to the management, regulation and protection of groundwater, in coordination with the entity concerned with energy in the emirate, and submit it to the executive council for approval.’ 5. analysis the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi the existing state of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi can be summarised as follows: • groundwater constitutes 60% of the total water consumed in the emirate (groundwater atlas of abu dhabi emirate, 2018). • groundwater is mainly used to irrigate crops in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent to irrigate crops in forests and parks. \\x03• groundwater extraction rates in the emirate are about 24 times the rates of natural recharge. • the state of the groundwater is constantly deteriorating as the levels of deterioration in some areas have led to their classification as restricted areas. • the increasing demand for groundwater requires joint or coordinated initiatives with various stakeholders and actors involved. \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 \\x03 \\x03 groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi surface aquifers are the most common reservoirs in terms of use and productivity, and most groundwater reservoirs in the emirate are non -renewable reservoirs. because of the excessive pumping of water from these reservoirs, groundwater levels decreased and groundwater quality deteriorated in many areas, as 79% of it became highly saline water, 18% medium brackish water, while only 3% of it is considered fresh water, according to the classification of water quality depending on salinity, which was developed by the environment agency - abu dhabi. pressures the food sufficiency rate, greening the desert, and expanding parks and gardens also contribu ted to an increase of demand for irrigation water, despite the existing effort among the concerned entities on the importance and necessity of preserving groundwater and the shift in policies and legislation to focus on groundwater preservation. the low ra te of water renewal, the lack of efficient irrigation techniques and the selection of crop quality contribute to increasing pressures, and cause excessive consumption of groundwater in the emirate, as the demand for groundwater has reached unsustainable le vels, leading to its depletion and to the deterioration of its quality. the results of the groundwater well inventory project in the emirate of abu dhabi indicate that the use of groundwater in the emirate reached 2,100 million cubic meters in \\x03 classification: confidential \\x03 ©sader\\x03 \\x03 irrigation of crops and irrigation of forests increases the demand for groundwater. the number of agricultural holdings in a bu dhabi increased by 38 times during the period from 1971 to 2019. the policies of expanding the agricultural sector, striving to achieve food security, raising \\x032017.

abu dhabi, in coordination with the department of energy and abu dhabi authority for agriculture and food safety, and in consultation with the authorities concerned with groundwater in the emirate, determines the ways to include these tools in its various plans. there is a list of these tools that have been agreed upon by the concerned entities to implement in order to achieve the policy objectives. each entity will be responsible for implementing the agreed - upon tools in accordance with the mechanisms it has in place. \\x03\\x03 \\x03 \", 'reference': ['Law No. (5) of 2016 concerning the regulation of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi', 'Executive Council Resolution No. (182) of 2022 concerning the general policy for the management, regulation and protection of groundwater in the emirate of abu dhabi', 'Law No. (1) of 1974 concerning the reorganisation of the governmental body in the emirate of abu dhabi and its amendments']}]]"
